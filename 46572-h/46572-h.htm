<p>In this transcription a black dotted underline indicates a hyperlink
to a page, illustration or footnote; hyperlinks are also indicated by
aqua highlighting when the mouse pointer hovers over them. A red dashed
<ins title="As shown here">underline</ins> indicates the presence of a concealed comment that can be
revealed by hovering the mouse pointer over the underlined text. Page
numbers are shown in the right margin. Footnotes are located at the end
of the book.</p>

<p>The <a href="images/coversmall.jpg">cover image</a> of the book was
created by the transcriber and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p><b>Potential problems:</b><br />
The text contains numerous foreign and uncommon typographic characters.
In addition to Greek, there are passages of Hebrew and Arabic text
(which read from right-to-left and are normally right justified) that
will not necessarily display correctly with all browsers. If some
characters look abnormal, first ensure that the browser’s ‘character
encoding’ is set to Unicode (UTF-8). You might also need to change the
default font. Standard fonts such as Times New Roman, Georgia or Lucida
Sans Unicode are sometimes adequate, but it might be necessary to use
a less-common font such as Arial Unicode MS, DejaVu, Segoe UI Symbol
or FreeSerif to see all characters correctly. Right alignment of the
Hebrew and Arabic paragraphs will generally only be apparent with a
monospaced font such as DejaVuSansMono.</p>

<p>Some diacritics don’t display consistently with all fonts and all
browsers. For example, the Greek letter υ̑ occurs in several words and
with some browsers and fonts the inverted breve is displaced towards
the following letter (as might be the case here); the same anomaly
occurs with macrons above letters in some old English words. The Hebrew
passage contains several letters with single or double overhead dots
(of uncertain significance) that can’t be replicated on screen – the
passage is hyperlinked to an image of the original for anyone wishing
to see it.</p>

<p>Roman numerals are widely used and often in archaic ways. Numerals
followed by an italicised <i>l</i>, <i>s</i>, or <i>d</i> indicate monetary values
in imperial pounds shillings and pence units, e.g. xxxiii<i>l</i>. vi<i>s</i>.
viii<i>d</i>. represents 33 pounds 6 shillings 8 pence (a space sometimes
separates the numeral from the unit). The last ‘i’ (‘one’) in a roman
numeral was often represented by the letter ‘j’; hence iiij<i>d</i> is
equivalent to 4 pence, and ‘ij holownesses’ should be read as ‘two
holownesses’.</p>

<p>Numerous portions of text enclosed within square brackets were inserted
by the author (not the transcriber) for clarification or translation,
as were several (sic) entries in the Hebrew and Arabic texts.</p>

<p>The index has many references to both page numbers and footnote
numbers, e.g. 24 n. (a single unnumbered footnote on p. 24), 93 n. 3,
126 nn. 4, 5, (pages containing multiple footnotes), and also to
numbered figures and plates. The original footnote numbering began
afresh at 1. on each page, but in this transcription footnotes are
numbered sequentially from the beginning of the book and the numbers
no longer correspond to those shown in the index. Readers can locate
a given indexed footnote by following the page hyperlink and counting
through to the appropriate footnote marker on that page. Figure and
plate references have been hyperlinked to the actual illustrations
rather than to the original page numbers because many illustrations
have been moved from their original position to be closer to the
relevant text discussion.</p>

<p><b>Errors and inconsistencies:</b><br />
Punctuation anomalies have been corrected silently (e.g. missing
periods, commas and semicolons, incorrect or missing quotation marks,
unpaired parentheses).</p>

<p>Unambiguous typographic errors such as the following, have been corrected silently:<br />
<span class="ml2em">Lexico nder-->Lexicon der</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">Aa-->As [a matter of fact]</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">Chiru gie-->Chirurgie</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">Weisbaden-->Wiesbaden</span><br />

but inconsistent spellings such as those below have not been altered:<br />
<span class="ml2em">paniculi/panniculi</span><br />

<span class="ml2em">diuidendo/dividendo</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">judgement/judgment</span></p>

(a paragraph number).</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The record of men and of movements, History teaches us the
growth and development of ideas. Our civilization is the final
expression of the two great master-​thoughts of the race. Seeking
an explanation of the pressing phenomena of life, man has peopled
the world with spiritual beings to whom he has assigned benign
or malign influences, to be invoked or propitiated. To the great
‘uncharted region’ (Gilbert Murray) with its mysteries, his religions
offer a guide; and through ‘a belief in spiritual beings’ (Tylor’s
definition of religion) he has built an altar of righteousness in his
heart. The birth of the other dominant idea, long delayed, is
comparatively recent. ‘The discovery of things as they really
are’ (Plato) by a study of nature was the great gift of the Greeks.
Knowledge, <i>scientia</i>, knowledge of things we see, patiently acquired
by searching out the secrets of nature, is the basis of our material
civilization. The true and lawful goal of the sciences, seen dimly
and so expressed by Bacon, is the acquisition of new powers by
new discoveries&mdash;that goal has been reached. Niagara has been
harnessed, and man’s dominion has extended from earth and sea
to the air. The progress of physics and of chemistry has revolutionized
man’s ways and works, while the new biology has changed
his mental outlook.</p>

<p>The greater part of this progress has taken place within the
memory of those living, and the mass of scientific work has accumulated
at such a rate that specialism has become inevitable.
While this has the obvious advantage resulting from a division
of labour, there is the penalty of a narrowed horizon, and groups
of men work side by side whose language is unintelligible to each
other.</p>

<p>Here is where the historian comes in, with two definite objects,<span class="pagenum" title="vi"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span>
teaching the method by which the knowledge has been gained,
the evolution of the subject, and correlating the innumerable
subdivisions in a philosophy at once, in Plato’s words, a science
in itself as well as of other sciences. For example, the student of
physics may know Crookes’s tubes and their relation to Röntgen,
but he cannot have a true conception of the atomic theory without
a knowledge of Democritus; and the exponent of Madame Curie
and of Sir J. J. Thomson will find his happiest illustrations from
the writings of Lucretius. It is unfortunate that the progress of
science makes useless the very works that made progress possible;
and the student is too apt to think that because useless now they
have never been of value.</p>

<p>The need of a comprehensive study of the methods of science
is now widely recognized, and to recognize this need important
Journals have been started, notably <i>Isis</i>, published by our Belgian
colleague George Sarton, interrupted, temporarily we hope, by
the war; and <i>Scientia</i>, an International Review of Scientific
Synthesis published by our Italian Allies. The numerous good
histories of science issued within the past few years bear witness to
a real demand for a wider knowledge of the methods by which
the present status has been reached. Among works from which
the student may get a proper outlook on the whole question may
be mentioned Dannemann’s <i>Die Naturwissenschaften in ihrer
Entwicklung und in ihrem Zusammenhang</i>, Bd. IV; <i>De la Méthode
dans les Sciences</i> , edited by Félix Thomas (Paris: Alcan); Marvin’s
<i>Living Past</i> , 3rd ed. (Clarendon Press, 1917); and Libby’s <i>Introduction
to the History of Science</i> (Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co., 1917).</p>

<p>This volume of Essays is the outcome of a quiet movement on
the part of a few Oxford students to stimulate a study of the
history of science. Shortly after his appointment to the Philip
Walker Studentship, Dr. Charles Singer (of Magdalen College)
obtained leave from Bodley’s Librarian and the Curators to have
a bay in the Radcliffe Camera set apart for research work in the
history of science and a safe installed to hold manuscripts; and
(with Mrs. Singer) offered £100 a year for five years to provide<span class="pagenum" title="vii"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a></span>
the necessary fittings, and special books not already in the
Library. The works relating to the subject have been collected
in the room, the objects of which are:</p>

<p>First, to place at the disposal of the general student a collection
that will enable him to acquire a knowledge of the development
of science and scientific conceptions.</p>

<p>Secondly, to assist the special student in research: (<i>a</i>) by placing
him in relationship with investigations already undertaken; (<i>b</i>)
by collecting information on the sources and accessibility of his
material; and (<i>c</i>) by providing him with facilities to work up his
material.</p>

<p>In spite of the absence of Dr. Singer on military duty for the
greater part of the time, the work has been carried on with conspicuous
success, to use the words of Bodley’s Librarian. Ten
special students have used the room. Professor Ramsay Wright
has made a study of an interesting Persian medical manuscript.
Professor William Libby, of Pittsburg, during the session of
1915–16, used the room in the preparation of his admirable
<i>History of Science</i> just issued. Dr. E. T. Withington, the well-​known
medical historian, is making a special study of the
old Greek writers for the new edition of Liddell and Scott’s
<i>Dictionary</i>. Miss Mildred Westland has helped Dr. Singer
with the Italian medical manuscripts. Mr. Reuben Levy has
worked at the Arabic medical manuscripts of Moses Maimonides.
Mrs. Jenkinson is engaged on a study of early medicine and magic.
Dr. J. L. E. Dreyer, the distinguished historian of Astronomy, has
used the room in connexion with the preparation of the <i>Opera
Omnia</i> of Tycho Brahe. Miss Joan Evans is engaged upon a
research on mediaeval lapidaries. Mrs. Singer has begun a study
of the English medical manuscripts, with a view to a complete
catalogue. How important this is may be judged from the first
instalment of her work dealing with the plague manuscripts in
the British Museum. With rare enthusiasm and energy Dr. Singer
has himself done a great deal of valuable work, and has proved
an intellectual ferment working far beyond the confines of Oxford.<span class="pagenum" title="viii"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a></span>
I have myself found the science history room of the greatest
convenience, and it is most helpful to have easy access on the
shelves to a large collection of works on the subject. Had the war
not interfered, we had hoped to start a <i>Journal of the History and
Method of Science</i> and to organize a summer school for special
students&mdash;hopes we may perhaps see realized in happier days.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this volume of essays (most of which were in course
of preparation when war was declared) is issued as a <i>ballon d’essai</i>.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap"><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</span></h3>

<p>In attempting to interpret the views of Hildegard on scientific
subjects, certain special difficulties present themselves. First is
the confusion arising from the writings to which her name has
been erroneously attached. To obtain a true view of the scope
of her work, it is necessary to discuss the authenticity of some of
the material before us. A second difficulty is due to the receptivity
of her mind, so that views and theories that she accepts in her
earlier works become modified, altered, and developed in her later
writings. A third difficulty, perhaps less real than the others, is
the visionary and involved form in which her thoughts are cast.</p>

<p>But a fourth and more vital difficulty is the attitude that she
adopts towards phenomena in general. To her mind there is no
distinction between physical events, moral truths, and spiritual experiences.
This view, which our children share with their mediaeval
ancestors, was developed but not transformed by the virile power
of her intellect. Her fusion of internal and external universe links
Hildegard indeed to a whole series of mediaeval visionaries, culminating
with Dante. In Hildegard, as in her fellow mystics, we find
that ideas on Nature and Man, the Moral World and the Material
Universe, the Spheres, the Winds, and the Humours, Birth and
Death, and even on the Soul, the Resurrection of the Dead, and the
Nature of God, are not only interdependent, but closely interwoven.
Nowadays we are well accustomed to separate our ideas into
categories, scientific, ethical, theological, philosophical, and so
forth, and we even esteem it a virtue to retain and restrain our<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
thoughts within limits that we deliberately set for them. To
Hildegard such classification would have been impossible and
probably incomprehensible. Nor do such terms as <i>parallelism</i> or
<i>allegory</i> adequately cover her view of the relation of the material
and spiritual. In her mind they are really interfused, or rather
they have not yet been separated.</p>

<p>Therefore, although in the following pages an attempt is made
to estimate her scientific views, yet the writer is conscious that
such a method must needs interpret her thought in a partial
manner. Hildegard, indeed, presents to us scientific thought as
an undifferentiated factor, and an attempt is here made to separate
it by the artificial but not unscientific process of dissection from
the organic matrix in which it is embedded.</p>

<p>The extensive literature that has risen around the life and
works of Hildegard has come from the hands of writers who have
shown no interest in natural knowledge, while those who have
occupied themselves with the history of science have, on their side,
largely neglected the period to which Hildegard belongs, allured
by the richer harvest of the full scholastic age which followed.
This essay is an attempt to fill in a small part of the lacuna.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Life and Works</span></h3>

<p>Hildegard of Bingen was born in 1098, of noble parentage, at
Böckelheim, on the river Nahe, near Sponheim. Destined from
an early age to a religious life, she passed nearly all her days
within the walls of Benedictine houses. She was educated and
commenced her career in the isolated convent of Disibodenberg,
at the junction of the Nahe and the Glan, where she rose to be
abbess. In 1147 she and some of her nuns migrated to a new
convent on the Rupertsberg, a finely placed site, where the smoky
railway junction of Bingerbrück now mars the landscape. Between
the little settlement and the important mediaeval town of Bingen
flowed the river Nahe, spanned by a bridge to which still clung
the name of the pagan Drusus (see Fig. 1). At this spot, a place
of ancient memories, secluded and yet linked to the world, our
abbess passed the main portion of her life, and here she closed her
eyes in the eighty-​second year of her age on September 17, 1180.</p>

<p>Hildegard was a woman of extraordinarily active and independent
mind. She was not only gifted with a thoroughly efficient
intellect, but was possessed of great energy and considerable<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
literary power, and her writings cover a wide range, betraying
the most varied activities and remarkable imaginative faculty.
The best known, and in a literary sense the most valuable of her
works, are the books of visions. She was before all things an
ecstatic, and both her <i>Scivias</i> (1141–50) and her <i>Liber divinorum
operum simplicis hominis</i> (1163–70) contain passages of real
power and beauty. Less valuable, perhaps, is her third long
mystical work (the second in point of time), the <i>Liber vitae
meritorum</i> (1158–62). She is credited with the authorship of an
interesting mystery-​play and of a collection of musical compositions,
while her life of St. Disibode, the Irish missionary
(594–674) to whom her part of the Rhineland owes its Christianity,
and her account of St. Rupert, a local saint commemorated in
the name ‘Rupertsberg’, both bear witness alike to her narrative
powers, her capacity for systematic arrangement, and her historical
interests. Her extensive correspondence demonstrates the influence<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
that she wielded in her own day and country, while her <i>Quaestionum
solutiones triginta octo</i>, her <i>Explanatio regulae sancti Benedicti</i>, and
her <i>Explanatio symboli sancti Athanasii ad congregationem sororum
suorum</i> give us glimpses of her activities as head of a religious house.</p>

<p>Her biographer, the monk Theodoric, records that she also
busied herself with the treatment of the sick, and credits her
with miraculous powers of <span class="nowrap">healing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> Some of the cited instances
of this faculty, as the curing of a love-​sick <span class="nowrap">maid,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> are, however,
but manifestations of personal ascendancy over weaker minds;
notwithstanding her undoubted acquaintance with the science of
her day, and the claims made for her as a pioneer of the hospital
system, there is no serious evidence that her treatment extended
beyond exorcism and prayer.</p>

<p>For her time and circumstance Hildegard had seen a fair
amount of the world. Living on the Rhine, the highway of
Western Germany, she was well placed for observing the traffic
and activities of men. She had journeyed at least as far north
as Cologne, and had traversed the eastern tributary of the great
river to Frankfort on the Main and to Rothenburg on <span class="nowrap">Taube.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>
Her own country, the basin of the Nahe and the Glan, she knew
intimately. She was, moreover, in constant communication with
Mayence, the seat of the archbishopric in which Bingen was
situated, and there has survived an extensive correspondence with
the ecclesiastics of Cologne, Speyer, Hildesheim, Trèves, Bamberg,
Prague, Nürnberg, Utrecht, and numerous other towns of Germany,
the Low Countries, and Central Europe.</p>

<p>Hildegard’s journeys, undertaken with the object of stimulating
spiritual revival, were of the nature of religious progresses,
but, like those of her contemporary, Bernard of Clairvaux, they
were in fact largely directed against the heretical and most cruelly
persecuted Cathari, an Albigensian sect widely spread in the
Rhine country of the twelfth century, whom Hildegard regarded
as ‘worse than the <span class="nowrap">Jews’.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> In justice to her memory it is to be<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
recalled that she herself was ever against the shedding of blood,
and had her less ferocious views prevailed, some more substantial
relic than the groans and tears of this people had reached our
time, while the annals of the Church had been spared the defilement
of an inexpiable stain.</p>

OF THE <i>SCIVIAS</i></span>
</div>

<p>Hildegard’s correspondence with St. Bernard, then preaching
his crusade, with four popes, Eugenius III, Anastasius IV,
Adrian IV, and Alexander III, and with the emperors Conrad
and Frederic Barbarossa, brings her into the current of general
European history, while she comes into some slight contact with
the story of our own country by her hortatory letters to Henry II
and to his consort Eleanor, the divorced wife of Louis <span class="nowrap">VII.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span></p>

<p>To complete a sketch of her literary activities, mention should
perhaps be made of a secret script and language, the <i>lingua
ignota</i>, attributed to her. It is a transparent and to modern
eyes a foolishly empty device that hardly merits the dignity of
the term ‘mystical’. It has, however, exercised the ingenuity
of several writers, and has been honoured by analysis at the hands
of Wilhelm <span class="nowrap">Grimm.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span></p>

<p>Ample material exists for a full biography of Hildegard, and
a number of accounts of her have appeared in the vulgar tongue.
Nearly all are marred by a lack of critical judgement that makes
their perusal a weary task, and indeed it would need considerable
skill to interest a detached reader in the minutiae of monastic
disputes that undoubtedly absorbed a considerable part of her
activities. Perhaps the best life of her is the earliest; it is certainly
neither the least critical nor the most credulous, and is by her
contemporaries, the monks Godefrid and <span class="nowrap">Theodoric.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span></p>
<p>The title of ‘saint’ is usually given to Hildegard, but she was
not in fact canonized. Attempts towards that end were made
under Gregory IX (1237), Innocent IV (1243), and John XXII
(1317). Miraculous cures and other works of wonder were claimed
for her, but either they were insufficiently miraculous or insufficiently
<span class="nowrap">attested.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> Those who have impartially traced her life in
her documents will agree with the verdict of the Church. Hers
was a fiery, a prophetic, in many ways a singularly noble spirit,
but she was not a saint in any intelligible sense of the word.</p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note</span></h3>

<p>There is no complete edition of the works of Hildegard. For
the majority of readers the most convenient collection will doubtless
be vol. 197 of Migne, <i>Patrologia Latina</i>. This can be supplemented
from Cardinal J. B. Pitra’s well-​edited <i>Analecta sacra</i>,
the eighth volume of which contains certain otherwise inaccessible
works of <span class="nowrap">Hildegard,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> and is the only available edition of
the <i>Liber vitae meritorum per simplicem hominem a vivente luce,
revelatorum</i>.</p>

<p>Manuscripts of the writings of our abbess are numerous and
are widely scattered over Europe. Four of them are of special
importance for our purpose, and are here briefly described.</p>

<p>(A) is a vast parchment of 480 folios in the Nassauische Landesbibliothek
at Wiesbaden. This much-​thumbed volume, still
bearing the chain that once tethered it to some monastic desk,
is written in a thirteenth-​century script. There is evidence that
it was prepared in the neighbourhood of Hildegard’s convent,
if not in that convent itself. It is interesting as a collection of
those works that the immediate local tradition attributed to her,
and is thus useful as a standard of <span class="nowrap">genuineness.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> Reference will
be made to it in the following pages as the <i>Wiesbaden Codex A.</i>
Its contents are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Liber Scivias.</p>

<p>2. Liber <i>vitae</i> meritorum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span></p>

<p>3. Liber divinorum operum.</p>

<p>4. Ad praelatos moguntienses.</p>

<p>5. Vita sanctae Hildegardis. By Godefrid and Theodoric.</p>

<p class="hangin">6. Liber epistolarum et orationum. This collection contains
292 items, and includes the Explanatio symboli Athanasii,
the Exposition of the Rule of St. Benedict, and the
Lives of St. Disibode and St. Rupert.</p>

<p>7. Expositiones evangeliorum.</p>

<p>8. Ignota lingua and Ignotae litterae.</p>

<p>9. Litterae villarenses.</p>

<p>10. Symphonia harmoniae celestum revelationum.</p></div>

<p>(B) is also at Wiesbaden, and will be cited here as the <i>Wiesbaden
Codex B</i>. It contains the <i>Scivias</i> only, and is a truly noble
volume of 235 folios, beautifully illuminated, in excellent preservation,
and of the highest value for the history of mediaeval
art. It has been thoroughly investigated by the late Dom Louis
<span class="nowrap">Baillet,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> who concluded that it was written in or near Bingen
between the dates 1160 and 1180. Its miniatures help greatly
in the interpretation of the visions, illustrating them often in the
minutest and most unexpected details. In view of the great
difficulty of visualizing much of her narrative, these miniatures
afford to our mind strong evidence that the MS. was supervised
by the prophetess herself, or was at least prepared under her
immediate tradition. This view is confirmed by comparing the
miniatures with those of the somewhat similar but inferior
Heidelberg MS. (C).</p>

<p>Both the miniatures and the script of the Wiesbaden Codex B
are the work of several hands. There are three distinct handwritings
discernible (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#II">II</a></span>). The earliest is attributed by
Baillet in his careful work to the twelfth century, while the
later writing is in thirteenth-​century <span class="nowrap">hands.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> It thus appears to
us that while Hildegard herself probably supervised the earlier
stages of the preparation of this volume, its completion took
place subsequent to her death. This view is sustained by the fact<span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
that some of the later miniatures are far less successful than the
earlier figures in aiding the interpretation of her text.</p>

<p>The two Wiesbaden MSS. appear to have remained at the
convent on the Rupertsberg opposite Bingen until the seventeenth
century. They were studied there by Trithemius in the fifteenth
century, and one of them at least was seen by the Mayence
Commission of 1489. Later they were noted by the theologians
Osiander (1527) and Wicelius (Weitzel, 1554), and by the antiquary
Nicolaus Serarius (1604). In 1632, during the Thirty Years’ War,
the Rupertsberg buildings were destroyed, the MSS. being removed
to a place of safety in the neighbouring settlement at Eibingen,
where they were again recorded in 1660 by the Jesuits Papenbroch
and <span class="nowrap">Henschen.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> At some unknown date they were transferred to
Wiesbaden, where they were examined in 1814 by <span class="nowrap">Goethe,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> and
a few years later by Wilhelm <span class="nowrap">Grimm,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> and where they have since
remained.</p>

Slightly simplified from the Wiesbaden Codex B, folio 14 r.
</div>

<p>(C) This MS. is at the University Library at Heidelberg. It
also contains only the <i>Scivias</i>, and it is the only known illuminated
MS. of that work except the Wiesbaden Codex B. The Heidelberg
MS. was prepared with great care in the early thirteenth century,
only a little later than its fellow, but its figures afford little aid
in the interpretation of the text. Thus, for instance, the Heidelberg
diagram of the universe (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IV">IV</a></span>) is of a fairly conventional type
which quite fails to illustrate the difficult description. The
obscurities of the text are, however, at once explained by a figure
in the Wiesbaden Codex B (Fig. 2): we thus obtain further indirect
evidence of the personal influence of Hildegard in the preparation
of that MS. The representation of Hildegard in the Heidelberg
MS. (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#III">III</a></span>) shows no resemblance to those in the Wiesbaden
Codex B (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#I">I</a></span>) or in the Lucca MS. (Plates <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VI">VI</a></span> to <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IX">IX</a></span>), which will
now be described.</p>

<p>(D) is an illustrated codex of the <i>Liber divinorum operum
simplicis hominis</i> at the Municipal Library at Lucca. It contains
ten beautiful miniatures, some of which are here reproduced
(Plates <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VI">VI</a></span> to <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IX">IX</a></span> and <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XI">XI</a></span>), as they are of special value for the<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
interpretation of Hildegard’s theories on the relation of macrocosm
and microcosm.</p>

<p>This Lucca MS. was described and its text printed in 1761
by Giovanni Domenico <span class="nowrap">Mansi,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> a careful scholar, who was himself
sometime Archbishop of Lucca. Mansi concluded that it was
written at the end of the twelfth or the beginning of the<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
thirteenth century. On palaeographical grounds a slightly later
date would nowadays probably be preferred (Plate <a href="#Vb"><span class="lowercase smcap">V</span> <i>b</i></a>).</p>

<p>The work consists of ten visions, each illustrated by a figure.
The date, character, and meaning of these miniatures raise special
problems to which only very superficial reference can here be
made. Unfortunately but little work has been done on early
Italian schools of miniaturists, and it is not a subject on which
any exact knowledge can yet be said to <span class="nowrap">exist.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p>Of these ten miniatures we may dismiss the last five in a few
words. The sixth to the tenth visions are of purely theological
interest, and the miniatures illustrating them are by a different
hand to the rest. They are all relatively crude products, which
appear to us to resemble other Italian work of the period at
which the MS. was written. We shall concentrate our attention
on the first five miniatures.</p>

<p>The first three miniatures of the Lucca MS. (Plates <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VI">VI</a></span> to <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VIII">VIII</a></span>)
may be attributed to the same hand on the following grounds:</p>

<p>1. All have a very similar inset figure of the prophetess below
the main picture.</p>

<p>2. The character of the principal figure of the first miniature
(Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VI">VI</a></span>) is almost identical with the curious universe-​embracing
double-​headed figure of the second miniature (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VII">VII</a></span>).</p>

<p>3. The features and draughtsmanship of the central figure of
the second miniature (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VII">VII</a></span>) are identical with those of the
third (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VIII">VIII</a></span>).</p>

<p>4. The beasts’ heads arranged round the second miniature
(Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VII">VII</a></span>) are exactly reproduced in the third miniature
(Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VIII">VIII</a></span>).</p>

<p>Now although these three miniatures are in some respects
unique, they contain elements enabling us to date them with an
approach to accuracy. These elements are to be found especially
in the central figure of the second and third miniatures (Plates <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VII">VII</a></span>
and <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VIII">VIII</a></span>).</p>

<p>About the middle of the thirteenth century, as Venturi has
<span class="nowrap">shown,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> there was a well-​marked change in Northern Italy in the
traditional representation of the form on the Cross. This change
was followed with almost slavish accuracy, and the new form is
well represented by a painting in the Uffizi Gallery (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#X">X</a></span>).<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
It is this figure of Christ which is reproduced by our miniaturist.
The central figure of Plates <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VII">VII</a></span> and <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VIII">VIII</a></span> resembles that of the
Uffizi crucifix, for instance, in the general pose of the body, in
the position of the legs and of the arms, in the treatment of the
abdominal musculature, in the method of outlining the muscles of
the legs and of the arms, and in a minute and very constant detail
by which the outline of the left side is continued with the fold of
the groin, thus giving an impression of the left thigh being
advanced on the right. Furthermore, the somewhat Byzantine
cast of countenance of the figure can be closely paralleled from
Northern Italian work of the same period. We therefore regard
these first three miniatures of the Lucca MS. as dating from
about the middle of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The remaining two miniatures (Plates <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IX">IX</a></span> and <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XI">XI</a></span>) offer special
difficulties. Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XI">XI</a></span> (illustrating the fifth vision) presents us with
no complete human figures, except the small and probably copied
inset of the prophetess below the miniature. The faces bear some
resemblance to those of the last five miniatures; the wings, on
the other hand, to those of the first miniature (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VI">VI</a></span>). It is
perhaps possible that this miniature was the work of an early
thirteenth-​century artist, and that the wings and some other details
were added by a later hand. The abnormal orientation, east to
the left and south above, suggests that we have here to do with
some special influence.</p>

<p>The most anomalous of all is, however, the beautiful fourth
miniature (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IX">IX</a></span>). This picture has a general feeling of the
early Renaissance, though it is hard to find in it any definite
humanistic element. The nude female figure in the upper left
quadrant is especially striking. No parallel to it is to be found
in the thirteenth-​century Italian miniatures that have so far been
reproduced, and it appears to us difficult to date the miniature
anterior to the fourteenth century at the very earliest. It is, in
any event, by a different hand to the others. The rashes on the
patients in the two upper and the right lower quadrants are perhaps
an attempt to render the fatal ‘God’s tokens’ of those waves of
pestilence that devastated the Italian peninsula in the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>Whatever the date of these miniatures, however, they reproduce
the meaning of the text of the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i> with a convincing
certainty and sureness of touch. This work is the most<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
difficult of all Hildegard’s mystical writings. Without the clues
provided by the miniatures, many passages in it are wholly
incomprehensible. It appears to us therefore by no means improbable
that the traditional interpretation of Hildegard’s works, thus
preserved to our time by these miniatures and by them alone,
may have had its origin from the mouth of the prophetess herself,
perhaps through another set of miniatures that has disappeared
or has not yet come to <span class="nowrap">light.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>


<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">The Spurious Scientific Works of Hildegard</span></h3>

<p>The scientific views of Hildegard are embedded in a theological
setting, and are mainly encountered in the <i>Scivias</i> and the
<i>Liber divinorum operum simplicis hominis</i>. To a less extent they
appear occasionally in her <i>Epistolae</i> and in the <i>Liber vitae meritorum</i>.</p>

<span class="smcap">Plate</span> IV.&emsp;<span class="ls02em">THE UNIVERSE</span>
</div>

<p>Two works of non-theological tone and definitely scientific
character have been printed in her name. One of these was
recently edited under the title <i>Beatae Hildegardis causae et curae</i><span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span>

deposited in the Royal Library of <span class="nowrap">Copenhagen.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> It is an ill-​written
document of the thirteenth century, and the original
work probably dates from this period. It has none of the
characteristics of the acknowledged work of Hildegard, and
indeed the only link with her name is the title, which is written
in a hand different from that of the text (Plate <a href="#Va"><span class="lowercase smcap">V</span> <i>a</i></a>). Nothing
could be more unlike the ecstatic but well-​ordered and systematic
work of the prophetess of Bingen than the prosy disorder of the
<i>Causae et curae</i>. Linguistically, also, it differs entirely from the
typical writings of Hildegard, for it is full of Germanisms, which
never interrupt the eloquence of her authentic works. Again,
Hildegard’s tendency to theoretical speculation, as for instance<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
on the nature of the elements or on the form of the Universe,
finds no place in the scrappy paragraphs of this apocryphal
compilation.</p>

<p>A second work, of somewhat similar character, is entitled
<i>Subtilitatum diversarumque creaturarum libri novem</i>. This is
clearly a compilation, and numerous passages in it can be traced
to such sources as Pliny, Walafrid Strabus, Marbod, Macer, the
Physiologus, Isidore Hispalensis, Constantine the African, and
the <i>Regimen Sanitatis Salerni</i>, only the last three of which exerted
a traceable influence on the genuine works of our authoress.
Nevertheless this <i>Liber subtilitatum</i> was early printed as Hildegard’s
work, along with a treatise attributed with as little justification
to another woman writer, Trotula, one of the ladies of
Salerno, whose name was also a household word in the Middle
Ages, and was freely attached to medical writings with which
she had little or nothing to <span class="nowrap">do.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> It is true that Hildegard’s contemporary
biographer, the monk Theodoric, assures us that she
had written <i>De natura hominis et elementorum, diversarumque
creaturarum</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> but there is nothing to suggest that the <i>Liber subtilitatum</i>
is intended thereby.</p>

<p>The modern scholars Daremberg and Reuss have edited the
<i>Liber subtilitatum</i> as Hildegard’s <span class="nowrap">composition,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> and the work
attracted the attention of <span class="nowrap">Virchow,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> but notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
authority of these names, the objections which apply to the genuineness
of the <i>Causae et curae</i> are also valid here:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The <i>Liber subtilitatum</i> is not included in the Wiesbaden
Codex A.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The phrase <i>De natura hominis et elementorum diversarumque
creaturarum</i>, used by Theodoric as a description and by Reuss as
a <span class="nowrap">title,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> would lead one to expect great emphasis on the nature
of the elements and their entry into the human frame. Such
emphasis is not, in fact, discoverable in the <i>Liber subtilitatum</i>,
which, moreover, does not treat of human anatomy or physiology.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) On the other hand, the genuine <i>Liber divinorum operum
simplicis hominis</i> does lay stress on these points. This is possibly
therefore the work to which Theodoric refers, and to it his description
certainly applies well.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) As in the <i>Causae et curae</i>, there are linguistic difficulties that
prevent us attributing the <i>Liber subtilitatum</i> to Hildegard. Such,
for instance, is the number of Germanisms as well as the marked
difference from the style and method of her acknowledged work.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) There are statements in the <i>Liber subtilitatum</i> that can
scarcely be attributed to our authoress. Having largely explored
the Rhine basin, and corresponding constantly with writers
beyond the Alps, how could she possibly derive all rivers, Rhine
and Danube, Meuse and Moselle, Nahe and Glan, from the same
lake (of Constance) as does the author of the <i>Liber subtilitatum</i><span class="nowrap">?<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Furthermore, although that spurious work has a chapter
<i>De elementis</i>, it reveals none of Hildegard’s most peculiar and
definite views as to their nature, origin, and <span class="nowrap">fate,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> nor does it refer
to the sphericity of the earth, to the vascular system of man, to<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
the humours and their relation to the winds and the elements, or
to a dozen other points on which, as we shall see, Hildegard had
views of her own.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of Hildegard’s apocryphal works,
brief reference may be made to the <i>Speculum futurorum temporum</i>,
a spurious production to which her name is often attached. It
exists in innumerable MSS., and has been frequently edited and
translated. It is the work of Gebeno, prior of Eberbach, who
wrote it in 1220, claiming that he extracted it from Hildegard’s
writings. Another work erroneously attributed to Hildegard
is entitled <i>Revelatio de fratribus quatuor mendicantium ordinum</i>,
and is directed against the four mendicant orders&mdash;Franciscans,
Dominicans, Carmelites, and Augustinians. It also has been
printed, but is wholly spurious, and was probably composed
towards the latter part of the thirteenth century.</p>


<h3>V. <span class="smcap">Sources of Hildegard’s Scientific Knowledge</span></h3>

<p>In the works of Hildegard we are dealing with the products
of a peculiarly original intellect, and her imaginative power and
mystical tendency make an exhaustive search into the origin of
her ideas by no means an easy task. With her theological standpoint,
as such, we are not here concerned, and unfortunately she
does not herself refer to any of her sources other than the Biblical
books; to have cited profane writers would indeed have involved
the abandonment of her claim that her knowledge was derived by
immediate inspiration from on high. Nevertheless it is possible
to form some idea, on internal evidence, of the origin of many of
her scientific conceptions.</p>

<p>The most striking point concerning the sources of Hildegard
is negative. There is no German linguistic element distinguishable
in her writings, and they show little or no trace of native
German <span class="nowrap">folk-lore.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> It is true that Trithemius of Sponheim (1462–1516),
who is often a very inaccurate chronicler, tells us that
Hildegard <span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>‘composed works in German as well as in Latin, although
she had neither learned nor used the latter tongue except for
simple <span class="nowrap">psalmody’.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> But with the testimony before us of the
writings themselves and of her skilful use of Latin, the statement
of Trithemius and even the hints of <span class="nowrap">Hildegard<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> may be
safely discounted and set down to the wish to magnify the element
of <span class="nowrap">inspiration.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> So far from her having been illiterate, we shall
show that the structure and details of her works betray a considerable
degree of learning and much painstaking study of the
works of others. Thus, for instance, she skilfully manipulates
the Hippocratic doctrines of miasma and the humours, and
elaborates a theory of the interrelation of the two which, though
developed on a plan of her own, is yet clearly borrowed in its
broad outline from such a writer as Isidore of Seville. Again, as
we shall see, some of her ideas on anatomy seem to have been
derived from Constantine the African, who belonged to the Benedictine
monastery of Monte <span class="nowrap">Cassino.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span></p>

<p>Hildegard lived at rather too early a date to drink from the
broad stream of new knowledge that was soon to flow into Europe
through Paris from its reservoir in Moslem Spain. Such drops
from that source as may have reached her must have trickled
in either from the earlier Italian translators or from the Jews
who had settled in the Upper Rhineland, for it is very unlikely
that she was influenced by the earlier twelfth-​century translations
of Averroes, Avicenna, Avicebron, and Avempace, that
passed into France from the Jews of Marseilles, Montpellier, and
<span class="nowrap">Andalusia.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> Her intellectual field was thus far more patristic
than would have been the case had her life-​course been even a
quarter of a century later.</p>

<p>Her science is primarily of the usual degenerate Greek type,
disintegrated fragments of Aristotle and Galen coloured and
altered by the customary mediaeval attempts to bring theory
into line with scriptural phraseology, though a high degree of
independence is obtained by the visionary form in which her
views are set. She exhibits, like all mediaeval writers on science,
the Aristotelian theory of the elements, but her statement of
the doctrine is illuminated by flashes of her own thoughts and is
coloured by suggestions from St. Augustine, Isidore Hispalensis,
Bernard Sylvestris of Tours, and perhaps from writings attributed
to Boethius.</p>

<p>The translator Gerard of Cremona (1114–87) was her contemporary,
and his labours made available for western readers
a number of scientific works which had previously circulated only
among Arabic-​speaking <span class="nowrap">peoples.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> Several of these works, notably
Ptolemy’s <i>Almagest</i>, Messahalah’s <i>De Orbe</i>, and the Aristotelian
<i>De Caelo et Mundo</i>, contain material on the form of the universe
and on the nature of the elements, and some of them probably
reached the Rhineland in time to be used by Hildegard. The<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
<i>Almagest</i>, however, was not translated until 1175, and was thus
inaccessible to <span class="nowrap">Hildegard.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> Moreover, as she never uses an Arabic
medical term, it is reasonably certain that she did not consult
Gerard’s translation of Avicenna, which is crowded with
Arabisms.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the influence of the Salernitan school may
be discerned in several of her scientific ideas. The <i>Regimen
Sanitatis</i> of Salerno, written about 1101, was rapidly diffused
throughout Europe, and must have reached the Rhineland at least
a generation before the <i>Liber Divinorum Operum</i> was composed.
This cycle of verses may well have reinforced some of her microcosmic
<span class="nowrap">ideas,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>
and suggested also her views on the generation of
<span class="nowrap">man,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> on the effects of wind
on <span class="nowrap">health,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> and on the influence of
the <span class="nowrap">stars.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span></p>

<p>On the subject of the form of the earth Hildegard expressed
herself definitely as a <span class="nowrap">spherist,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> a point of view more widely
accepted in the earlier Middle Ages than is perhaps generally
supposed. She considers in the usual mediaeval fashion that this
globe is surrounded by celestial spheres that influence terrestrial
<span class="nowrap">events.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> But while she claims that human affairs, and especially
human diseases, are controlled, under God, by the heavenly
cosmos, she yet commits herself to none of that more detailed
astrological doctrine that was developing in her time, and came
to efflorescence in the following centuries. In this respect she
follows the earlier and somewhat more scientific spirit of such
writers as Messahalah, rather than the wilder theories of her own
age. The shortness and simplicity of Messahalah’s tract on the
sphere made it very popular. It was probably one of the earliest
to be translated into Latin; and its contents would account for<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
the change which, as we shall see, came over Hildegard’s scientific
views in her later years.</p>

<p>The general conception of the universe as a series of concentric
elemental spheres had certainly penetrated to Western Europe
centuries before Hildegard’s time. Nevertheless the prophetess
presents it to her audience as a new and striking revelation. We
may thus suppose that translations of Messahalah, or of whatever
other work she drew upon for the purpose, did not reach the
Upper Rhineland, or rather did not become accepted by the circles
in which Hildegard moved, until about the decade 1141–50, during
which she was occupied in the composition of her <i>Scivias</i>.</p>

<p>There is another cosmic theory, the advent of which to
her country, or at least to her circle, can be approximately
dated from her work. Hildegard exhibits in a pronounced but
peculiar and original form the doctrine of the macrocosm and
microcosm. Hardly distinguishable in the <i>Scivias</i> (1141–50), it
appears definitely in the <i>Liber Vitae Meritorum</i>
<span class="nowrap">(1158–62),<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> in
which work, however, it takes no very prominent place, and is
largely overlaid and concealed by other lines of thought. But in
the <i>Liber Divinorum Operum</i> (1163–70) this belief is the main
theme. The book is indeed an elaborate attempt to demonstrate
a similarity and relationship between the nature of the Godhead,
the constitution of the universe, and the structure of man, and
it thus forms a valuable compendium of the science of the day
viewed from the standpoint of this theory.</p>

<p>From whence did she derive the theory of macrocosm and
microcosm? In outline its elements were easily accessible to her
in Isidore’s <i>De Rerum Natura</i> as well as in the Salernitan poems.
But the work of Bernard Sylvestris of Tours, <i>De mundi universitate
sive megacosmus et microcosmus</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> corresponds so closely both in
form, in spirit, and sometimes even in phraseology, to the <i>Liber
Divinorum Operum</i> that it appears to us certain that Hildegard
must have had access to it also. Bernard’s work can be dated<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
between the years 1145–53 from his reference to the papacy of
Eugenius III. This would correspond well with the appearance
of his doctrines in the <i>Liber Vitae Meritorum</i> (1158–62) and their
full development in the <i>Liber Divinorum Operum</i> (1163–70).</p>

<p>Another contemporary writer with whom Hildegard presents
points of contact is Hugh of St. Victor <span class="nowrap">(1095–1141).<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> In his writings
the doctrine of the relation of macrocosm and microcosm is more
veiled than with Bernard Sylvestris. Nevertheless, his symbolic
universe is on the lines of Hildegard’s belief, and the plan of his
<i>De arca Noe mystica</i> presents many parallels both to the <i>Scivias</i>
and to the <i>Liber Divinorum Operum</i>. If these do not owe anything
directly to Hugh, they are at least products of the same mystical
movement as were his works.</p>

<p>We may also recall that at Hildegard’s date very complex
cabalistic systems involving the doctrine of macrocosm and
microcosm were being elaborated by the Jews, and that she
lived in a district where Rabbinic mysticism specially <span class="nowrap">flourished.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span>
Benjamin of Tudela, who visited Bingen during Hildegard’s lifetime,
tells us that he found there a congregation of his people.
Since we know, moreover, that she was familiar with the <span class="nowrap">Jews,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span>
it is possible that she may have derived some of the very complex
macrocosmic conceptions with which her last work is crowded
from local Jewish students.</p>

<p>The Alsatian Herrade de Landsberg (died 1195), a contemporary
of Hildegard, developed the microcosm theory along lines similar
to those of our abbess, and it is probable that the theory, in the
form in which these writers present it, reached the Upper Rhineland
somewhere about the middle or latter half of the twelfth century.</p>

<p>Apart from the Biblical books, the work which made the
deepest impression on Hildegard was probably Augustine’s <i>De
Civitate Dei</i>, which seems to form the background of a large part
of the <i>Scivias</i>. The books of Ezekiel and of Daniel, the Gospel
of Nicodemus, the Shepherd of Hermas, and the Apocalypse, all
contain a lurid type of vision which her own spiritual experiences<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
would enable her to utilize, and which fit in well with her microcosmic
doctrines. Ideas on the harmony and disharmony of the
elements she may have picked up from such works as the Wisdom
of Solomon and the Pauline writings, though it is obvious that
Isidore of Seville and the <i>Regimen Sanitatis Salerni</i> were also
drawn upon by her.</p>

</div>

<p>Her figure of the Church in the <i>Scivias</i> reminds us irresistibly
of Boethius’ vision of the gracious feminine form of Philosophy.
Again, the visions of the punishments of Hell which Hildegard
recounts in the <i>Liber Vitae</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>Meritorum</i><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> bear resemblance to the
work of her contemporary Benedictine, the monk Alberic the
younger of Monte Cassino, to whom Dante also became <span class="nowrap">indebted.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegard repeatedly assures us that most of her knowledge
was revealed to her in waking visions. Some of these we shall
seek to show had a pathological basis, probably of a migrainous
character, and she was a sufferer from a condition that would
nowadays probably be classified as hystero-​epilepsy. Too much
stress, however, can easily be laid on the ecstatic presentment of
her scientific views. Visions, it must be remembered, were ‘the
fashion’ at the period, and were a common literary device. Her
contemporary Benedictine sister, Elizabeth of Schönau, as well
as numerous successors, as for example Gertrude of Robersdorf,
adopted the same mechanism. The use of the vision for this
purpose remained popular for centuries, and we may say of these
writers, as Ampère says of Dante, that ‘the visions gave not the
genius nor the poetic inspiration, but the form merely in which
they were realized’.</p>

<p>The contemporaries of Hildegard who provide the closest
analogy to her are Elizabeth of Schönau (died 1165), whose
visions are recounted in her life by <span class="nowrap">Eckbertus;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> and Herrade
de Landsberg, Abbess of Hohenburg in Alsace, the priceless
MS. of whose <i>Hortus Deliciarum</i> was destroyed by the Germans
in the siege of Strasbourg in <span class="nowrap">1870.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> With Elizabeth of Schönau,<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
who lived in her neighbourhood, Hildegard was in frequent
correspondence. With Herrade she had, so far as is known,
no direct communication; but the two were contemporary,
lived not very far apart, and under similar political and cultural
conditions. Elizabeth’s visions present some striking analogies
to those of Hildegard, while the figures of Herrade, of which copies
have fortunately survived, often suggest the illustrations of the
Wiesbaden or of the Lucca MSS.</p>


<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">The Structure of the Material Universe</span></h3>

<p>To the student of the history of science, Hildegard’s beliefs
as to the nature and structure of the universe are among the
most interesting that she has to impart. Her earlier theories
are in some respects unique among mediaeval writers, and we
possess in the Wiesbaden Codex B a diagram enabling us to
interpret her views with a definiteness and certainty that would
otherwise be impossible.</p>

<p>Hildegard’s universe is geocentric, and consists of a spherical
<span class="nowrap">earth,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> around which are arranged a number of concentric shells
or zones. The inner zones are spherical, the outer oval, and the
outermost of all egg-​shaped, with one end prolonged and more
pointed than the other Fig. (<a href="#Fig_02">2</a>). The concentric structure is
a commonplace of mediaeval science, and is encountered, for
instance, in the works of Bede, Isidore, Alexander of Neckam,
Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, and Dante. To all these writers,
however, the universe is spherical. The egg-​shape is peculiar to
Hildegard. Many of the <i>Mappaemundi</i> of the Beatus and other
types exhibit the <i>surface</i> of the habitable earth itself as oval,
and it was from such charts that Hildegard probably gained her
conception of an oval universe. In her method of orientation
also she follows these maps, placing the east at the top of the
page where we are accustomed to place the <span class="nowrap">north.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span></p>

<p>It is unfortunate that she does not deal with geography in the
restricted sense, and so we are not in full possession of her views
on the antipodes, a subject of frequent derision to patristic and
of misconception to scholastic writers. She does, however, vaguely<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
refer to the inversion of seasons and climates in the opposite
<span class="nowrap">hemisphere,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> though she confuses the issue by the adoption of
a theory widespread in the Middle Ages and reproduced in the
<i>Divina Commedia</i>, that the antipodean surface of the earth is
uninhabitable, since it is either beneath the ocean or in the mouth
of the <span class="nowrap">Dragon<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span>
(Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XI">XI</a></span>, cp. Fig. <a href="#Fig_04">4</a>). The nature of the antipodean
inversion of climates was clearly grasped by her contemporary,
Herrade de Landsberg (Fig. <a href="#Fig_05">5</a>).</p>

<p>Hildegard’s views as to the internal structure of the terrestrial
sphere are also somewhat difficult to follow. Her obscure and
confused doctrine of Purgatory and Hell has puzzled other writers
besides <span class="nowrap">ourselves,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> nor need we consider it here, but she held
that the interior of the earth contained two vast spaces shaped
like truncated cones, where punishment was meted out and
whence many evil things had <span class="nowrap">issue.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> Her whole scheme presents
analogies as well as contrasts to that of her kindred spirit
<span class="nowrap">Dante.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> Hildegard, however, who died before the thirteenth
century had dawned, presents us with a scheme far less definite
and elaborated than that of her great successor, who had all
the stores of the golden age of scholasticism on which to
draw.</p>

<p>In Hildegard’s first diagram of the universe, which is of the
nature of an ‘optical section’, the world, the <i>sphaera elementorum</i>
of Johannes Sacro Bosco and other mediaeval writers, is
diagrammatically represented as compounded of earth, air, fire,
and water confusedly mixed in what her younger contemporary,
Alexander of Neckam (1157–1217), calls ‘a certain concordant
discord of the elements’. In the illustrations to the Wiesbaden
Codex B the four elements have each a conventional method
of representation, which appears again and again in the different
miniatures (Fig. <a href="#Fig_02">2</a> and Plates <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XIIa">XII</a></span> and <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XIII">XIII</a></span>).</p>

<p>Around this world with its four elements is spread the
atmosphere, the <i>aer lucidus</i> or <i>alba pellis</i>, diagrammatically
represented, like the earth which it enwraps, as circular. Through
this <i>alba pellis</i> no creature of earth can penetrate. Beyond are<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
ranged in order four further shells or zones. Each zone contains
one of the cardinal winds, and each cardinal wind is accompanied
by two accessory winds, represented in the traditional fashion by
the breath of supernatural beings.</p>

<p>Of the four outer zones the first is the <i>aer aquosus</i>, also
round, from which blows the east wind. In the outer part of the
<i>aer aquosus</i> float the clouds, and according as they contract or
expand or are blown aside, the heavenly bodies above are revealed
or concealed.</p>

<p>Enwrapping the <i>aer aquosus</i> is the <i>purus aether</i>, the widest
of all the zones. The long axis of this, as of the remaining
outer shells, is in the direction from east to west, thus determining
the path of movement of the heavenly bodies. Scattered
through the <i>purus aether</i> are the constellations of the fixed stars,
and arranged along the long axis are the moon and the two
inner planets. From this zone blows the west wind. The position
and constitution of this <i>purus aether</i> is evidently the result of
some misinterpretation of Aristotelian writings.</p>

<p>The next zone, the <i>umbrosa pellis</i> or <i>ignis niger</i>, is a narrow
dark shell, whence proceed the more dramatic meteorological
events. Here, following on the hints of the Wisdom of Solomon
(chap. v) and the Book of Job (chap. xxxviii), are situated the
diagrammatically portrayed treasuries of lightning and of hail.
From here the tempestuous north wind bursts forth. This <i>ignis
niger</i> is clearly comparable to the <i>dry earthy exhalation</i> that
works of the Peripatetic school regard as given off by the outer
fiery zone. The presence of the <i>ignis niger</i> thus suggests some
contact on the part of the authoress with the teaching of the
<i>Meteorologica</i> of <span class="nowrap">Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span></p>

<p>The outermost layer of all is a mass of flames, the <i>lucidus
ignis</i>. Here are the sun and the three outer planets, and from
here the south wind pours its scorching breath (Fig. <a href="#Fig_02">2</a>).</p>

<p>The movements of the four outer zones around each other,
carrying the heavenly bodies with them, are attributed to the<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
winds in each zone. The seasonal variations in the movements
of the heavenly bodies, along with the recurring seasons themselves,
are also determined by the prevalent winds, which, acting
as the motive power upon the various zones, form a celestial
parallelogram of forces. In this way is ingeniously explained also
why in spring the days lengthen and in autumn they shorten
until in either case an equinox is reached (Fig. <a href="#Fig_02">2</a>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I looked and behold the east and the south wind with their
collaterals, moving the firmament by the power of their breath,
caused it to revolve over the earth from east to west; and in the
same way the west and north winds and their collaterals, receiving
the impulse and projecting their blast, thrust it back again
from west to east<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>‘I saw also that as the days began to lengthen, the south
wind and his collaterals gradually raised the firmament in the
southern zone upwards towards the north, until the days ceased
to grow longer. Then when the days began to shorten, the north
wind with his collaterals, shrinking from the brightness of the
sun, drove the firmament back gradually southward until by
reason of the lengthening days the south wind began yet again
to raise it <span class="nowrap">up’<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span>

<p>Intimately bound up not only with her theory of the nature
and structure of the universe but also with her eschatological
beliefs is Hildegard’s doctrine of the elements. Before the fall
of man these were arranged in a <span class="nowrap">harmony,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> which was disturbed
by that catastrophe (Plate <a href="#XIIa"><span class="lowercase smcap">XII</span> <i>a</i></a>)<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> so that they have since
remained in the state of mingled confusion in which we always
encounter them on the terrestrial globe. This <i>mistio</i>, to use
the mediaeval Aristotelian term, is symbolized by the irregular
manner in which the elements are represented in the central
sphere of the diagram of the universe (Fig. <a href="#Fig_02">2</a>). Thus mingled
they will remain until subjected to the melting-​pot of the Last<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
Judgement (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XIII">XIII</a></span>)<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> when they will emerge in a new and eternal
harmony, no longer mixed as matter, but separate and pure,
parts of the new heaven and the new earth (Plate <a href="#XIIb"><span class="lowercase smcap">XII</span> <i>b</i></a>)<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘But the heavens and the earth, which are now<span class="ell">,..</span>. are kept
in store and reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of ungodly men<span class="ell">...</span>. But the day of the Lord will come <span class="ell">..</span>. in
the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and
the works that are therein shall be burned up<span class="ell">...</span>. Nevertheless
we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new
earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness’ (2 Peter iii. 7, 10, and 13).</p></div>

<p>So Hildegard, acting on a scriptural hint, is enabled to
dematerialize her doctrine of the after-​things.</p>

<p>But although since man’s fall the elements have lost their
order and their harmony on this terrestrial orb, yet is that harmony
still in part preserved in the celestial spheres that encircle and
surround our globe; and water, air, earth, and fire have each
their respective representatives in the four concentric zones, the
<i>aer aquosus</i>, the <i>purus aether</i>, the <i>umbrosa pellis</i>, and the <i>lucidus
ignis</i> (Fig. <a href="#Fig_02">2</a>). These are the ‘superior elements’ which still
retain some at least of their individuality and primal purity.
From each of their spheres blows, as we have seen, one of the
cardinal winds, and each wind partakes of the elemental character
of the zone whence it issues, and has a corresponding influence<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
on man’s body, since each of the four humours is specifically
affected by the element to which it corresponds.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Then I saw that by the diverse quality of the winds, and of
the atmosphere as they in turn sweep through it, the humours in
man are agitated and altered. For in each of the superior elements
there is a breath of corresponding quality by which, through the
power of the winds, the corresponding element [below] is forced
to revolve in the atmosphere, and in no other way is it moved.
And by one of those winds, with the agency of sun, moon, and
stars, the atmosphere which tempers the world is breathed <span class="nowrap">forth’<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span>
(Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VII">VII</a></span>).</p></div>

<p>This doctrine of the relation of the various winds to the four
elements and through them to the four humours is found in the
<i>De Rerum Natura</i> of Isidore of Seville, and is occasionally illustrated
in European MSS. from the ninth century <span class="nowrap">onward,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> but we meet
it set forth with special definiteness in the twelfth century in the
translations from Messahalah. It is encountered also in the work
of Herrade de Landsberg. In and after the thirteenth century
it had become a commonplace.</p>

<p>The description we have given of the universe was in the
main set forth by Hildegard in her first work, the <i>Scivias</i> <span class="nowrap">(1141–50).<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span>
Subsequently she became dissatisfied with the account she
had given, and while not withdrawing it, she sought in the <i>Liber
Divinorum Operum</i> (1163–70) so to modify the original presentment
as to bring it more into line with accepted views. Thus
she writes: ‘There appeared to me in vision a <i>disk</i> very like that
object which I saw twenty-​eight years ago of the form of an <i>egg</i>,
in the third vision of my book <i>Scivias</i>. In the outer part of the
disk there was as it were the <i>lucidus ignis</i>, and beneath it the
circle of the <i>ignis niger</i> was portrayed <span class="ell">..</span>. and these two circles
were so joined as to be one circle.’ There was thus one outer
zone representing the fire. <span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>‘Under the circle of the <i>ignis niger</i>
there was another circle in the likeness of the <i>purus aether</i> which
was of the same width as the two conjoined [outer] fiery circles.
And below this circle again was the circle of the <i>aer aquosus</i> as
wide as the <i>lucidus ignis</i>. And below this circle was yet another
circle, the <i>fortis et albus lucidusque aer</i> <span class="ell">..</span>. the width whereof
was as the width of the <i>ignis niger</i>, and these circles were joined
to make one circle which was thus again of width equal to the
outer two. Again, under this last circle yet another circle, the <i>aer
tenuis</i>, was distinguishable, which could be seen to raise itself as
a cloud, sometimes high and light, sometimes depressed and dark,
and to diffuse itself as it were throughout the whole disk<span class="ell">...</span>. The
outermost fiery circle perfuses the other circles with its fire, while
the watery circle saturates them with its moisture, [cp. Wisdom
of Solomon, xix. 18–20]. And from the extreme eastern part
of the disk to the extreme west a line is stretched out [i.e. the
equator] which separates the northern zones from the <span class="nowrap">others’<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span>

</div>

<p>The earth lies concentrically with the <i>aer tenuis</i>, and its measurements
are given thus: ‘In the midst of the <i>aer tenuis</i> a globe
was indicated, the circumference of which was everywhere equidistant
from the <i>fortis et albus lucidusque aer</i>, and it was as far
across as the depth of the space from the top of the highest
circle to the extremity of the clouds, or from the extremity of the
clouds to the circumference of the inner <span class="nowrap">globe’<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">68</a> (Fig. 3).</span></p>

<p>In her earlier work, the <i>Scivias</i>, Hildegard had not apparently
realized the need of accounting for the independent movements of
the planets other than the sun and moon. She had thus placed the
moon and two of the moving stars in the <i>purus aether</i>, and the sun
and the three remaining moving stars in the <i>lucidus ignis</i>. Since
these spheres were moved by the winds, their contained planets
would be subject to the same influences. In the <i>Liber Divinorum
Operum</i>, however, she has come to realize how independent the
movements of the planets really are, and she invokes a special cause
for their vagaries. ‘I looked and behold in the outer fire (<i>lucidus
ignis</i>) there appeared a circle which girt about the whole firmament
from the east westward. From it a blast produced a movement
from west to east in the opposite direction to the movement of the
firmament. But this blast did not give forth his breath earthward
as did the other winds, but instead thereof it governed the course
of the <span class="nowrap">planets.’<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span> The source of the blast is represented in the Lucca

<p>These curious passages were written at some date after 1163,
when Hildegard was at least 65 years old. They reveal our prophetess
<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>attempting to revise much of her earlier theory of the
universe, and while seeking to justify her earlier views, endeavouring
also to bring them into line with the new science that was now
just beginning to reach her world. Note that (<i>a</i>) the universe
has become round; (<i>b</i>) there is an attempt to arrange the zones
according to their density, i.e. from without inwards, fire, air
(ether), water, earth; (<i>c</i>) exact measurements are given; (<i>d</i>)
the watery zone is continued earthward so as to mingle with the
central circle. In all these and other respects she is joining the
general current of mediaeval science then beginning to be moulded
by works translated from the Arabic. Her knowledge of the
movements of the heavenly bodies is entirely innocent of the
doctrine of epicycles, but in other respects her views have come
to resemble those, for instance, of Messahalah, one of the simplest
and easiest writers on the sphere available in her day. Furthermore,
her conceptions have developed so as to fit in with the<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
macrocosm-​microcosm scheme which she grasped about the year
1158. Even in her latest work, however, her theory of the universe
exhibits differences from that adopted by the schoolmen, as may
be seen by comparing her diagram with, for example, the scheme
of Dante (Fig. 4).</p>

</div>

<p>Like many mediaeval writers, Hildegard would have liked to
imagine an ideal state of the elemental spheres in which the
rarest, fire, was uppermost, and the densest, earth, undermost.
Such a scheme was, in fact, purveyed by Bernard Sylvestris and
by Messahalah. Her conceptions were however disturbed by the
awkward facts that water penetrated below the earth, and indeed
sought the lowest level, while air and not water lay immediately
above the earth’s surface. Mediaeval writers adopted various
devices and expended a great amount of ingenuity in dealing with
this discrepancy, which was a constant source of obscurity and
confusion. Hildegard devotes much space and some highly involved
allegory both in the <i>Scivias</i> and in the <i>Liber Divinorum
Operum</i> to the explanation of the difficulty, while Dante himself
wrote a treatise in high scholastic style on this very <span class="nowrap">subject.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span></p>

<h3>VII. <span class="smcap">Macrocosm and Microcosm</span></h3>

<p>The winds and elements of the outer universe, the macrocosm,
become in Hildegard’s later schemes intimately related to structures
and events within the body of man himself, the microcosm,
the being around whom the universe centres. The terms <i>macrocosm</i>
and <i>microcosm</i> are not employed by her, but in her last great
work, the <i>Liber Divinorum Operum</i>, she succeeds in most eloquent
and able fashion in synthesizing into one great whole, centred
around this doctrine, her theological beliefs and her physiological
knowledge, together with her conceptions of the working of the
human mind and of the structure of the universe. The work is
thus an epitome of the science of the time viewed through the
distorting medium of this theory. In studying it the modern
reader is necessarily hampered by the bizarre and visionary form
into which the whole subject is cast. Nevertheless the scheme,
though complex and difficult, is neither incoherent nor insane,
as at first sight it may seem. On the contrary, it is a highly<span class="pagenum hide" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
systematic and skilful presentment of a cosmic theory which for
centuries dominated scientific thought.</p>

<p>As an explanation of the complexity of existence which thinkers
of all ages have sought to bring within the range of some simple
formula, this theory of the essential similarity of macrocosm and
microcosm held in the Middle Ages, during the Renaissance, and
even into quite modern times, a position comparable to that of the
theory of evolution in our own age. If at times it passed into
folly and fantasy, it should be remembered that it also fulfilled
a high purpose. It gave a meaning to the facts of nature and
a formula to the naturalist, it unified philosophic systems, it
exercised the ingenuity of theologians, and gave a convenient
framework to prophecy, while it seemed to illumine history and
to provide a key and meaning to life itself. Even now it is not
perhaps wholly devoid of message, but as a phenomenon in the
history of human thought, a theory which appealed to such
diverse scientific writers as Seneca, Albertus Magnus, Paracelsus,
Gilbert, Harvey, Boyle, and Leibnitz, is surely worthy of attention.</p>

<p>In essaying to interpret the views of our authoress on this
difficult subject, we rely mainly on the text of the <i>Liber Divinorum
Operum</i>, supplemented by the beautiful illuminations of that work
which adorn the Lucca MS. The book opens with a truly remarkable
vision (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VI">VI</a></span>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I saw a fair human form and the countenance thereof was of
such beauty and brightness that it had been easier to gaze upon
the sun. The head thereof was girt with a golden circlet through
which appeared another face as of an aged man. From the neck
of the figure on either side sprang a pinion which swept upward
above the circlet and joined its fellow on high. And where on
the right the wing turned upward, was portrayed an eagle’s head
with eyes of flame, wherein appeared as in a mirror the lightning
of the angels, while from a man’s head in the other wing the
lightning of the stars did radiate. From either shoulder another
wing reached to the knees. The figure was robed in brightness
as of the sun, while the hands held a lamb shining with light.
Beneath, the feet trampled a horrible black monster of revolting
shape, upon the right ear of which a writhing serpent fixed <span class="nowrap">itself.’<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span></p></div>

<p>Hildegard thus supposes that the whole universe is permeated
by a single living spirit, the figure of the vision. This spirit of
the macrocosm, the <i>Nous</i> or ‘world spirit’ of the hermetic and
Neoplatonic literature, the impersonated <i>Nature</i>, as we may
perhaps render it, is in its turn controlled by the Godhead that
pervades the form and is represented rising from its vertex as
a second human face. Nature, the spirit of the cosmic order,
controls and holds in subjection the hideous monster, the principle
of death and dissolution, the <i>Hyle</i> or primordial matter of
the Neoplatonists, whose chaotic and anarchic force would shatter
and destroy this fair world unless fettered by a higher power.</p>

<p>With the details of the visionary figure we need not <span class="nowrap">delay,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> but
we pass to the description of the structure of the macrocosm itself,
to which the second vision is devoted (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VII">VII</a></span>). Here appears
the same figure of the macrocosmic spirit. But now the head and
feet only are visible, and the arms are outstretched to enclose
the disk of the universe which conceals the body. Although the
macrocosm now described is considerably altered from Hildegard’s
original scheme of the universe, she yet declares, ‘I saw in the
bosom of the form the appearance of a disk of like sort to that
which twenty-​eight years before I had seen in the third vision,

<p>‘In the middle of the disk [of the universe] there appeared
the form of a man, the crown of whose head and the soles of
whose feet extended to the <i>fortis et albus lucidusque aer</i>, and his
hands were outstretched right and left to the same circle<span class="ell">...</span>.
Towards these parts was an appearance as of four heads; a leopard,
a wolf, a lion, and a bear. Above the head of the figure in the
zone of the <i>purus aether</i>, I saw the head of the leopard emitting
a blast from its mouth, and on the right side of the mouth the
blast, curving itself somewhat backwards, was formed into a crab’s
head <span class="ell">..</span>. with two chelae; while on the left side of the mouth
a blast similarly curved ended in a stag’s head. From the mouth
of the crab’s head, another blast went to the middle of the space
between the leopard and the lion; and from the stag’s head
a similar blast to the middle of the space between the leopard
and the bear <span class="ell">..</span>. and all the heads were breathing towards the
figure of the man. Under his feet in the <i>aer aquosus</i> there appeared
as it were the head of a wolf, sending forth to the right a blast
extending to the middle of the half space between its head and
that of the bear, where it assumed the form of the stag’s head;
and from the stag’s mouth there came, as it were, another breath
which ended in the middle line. From the left of the wolf’s mouth
arose a breath which went to the midst of the half space between
the wolf and the lion, where was depicted another crab’s head <span class="ell">..</span>.
from whose mouth another breath ended in the same middle
line<span class="ell">...</span>. And the breath of all the heads extended sideways from
one to another<span class="ell">...</span>. Moreover on the right hand of the figure in
the <i>lucidus ignis</i>, from the head of the lion, issued a breath
which passed laterally on the right into a serpent’s head and on
the left into a lamb’s head <span class="ell">..</span>. similarly on the figure’s left in the
<i>ignis niger</i> there issued a breath from the bear’s head ending
on its right in the head of [another] lamb, and on its left in another
serpent’s head<span class="ell">...</span>. And above the head of the figure the seven
planets were ranged in order, three in the <i>lucidus ignis</i>, one projecting
into the <i>ignis niger</i> and three into the <i>purus aether</i><span class="ell">...</span>.
And in the circumference of the circle of the <i>lucidus ignis</i> there
appeared the sixteen principal stars, four in each quadrant between
the heads<span class="ell">...</span>. Also the <i>purus aether</i> and <i>the fortis et albus lucidusque
aer</i> seemed to be full of stars which sent forth their rays towards
the clouds, whence <span class="ell">..</span>. tongues like rivers descended to the disk
and towards the figure, which was thus surrounded and influenced
by these <span class="nowrap">signs.’<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span></p></div>

<p>The third vision is devoted to an account of the human body,
the microcosm (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#VIII">VIII</a></span>), with a comparison of its organs to the
parts of the macrocosmic scheme, together with a detailed account
of the effects of the heavenly bodies on the humours in man,
the whole brought into a strongly theological setting. Some of
these views are set forth below in the chapter on anatomy and
physiology.</p>

<p>The fourth vision explains the influence of the heavenly
bodies and of the superior elements on the power of nature as
exhibited on the surface of the earth. It is illustrated by a
charming miniature in the Lucca MS. (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IX">IX</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span></p>

<p>‘I saw that the upper fiery firmament was stirred, so that as
it were ashes were cast therefrom to earth, and they produced
rashes and ulcers in men and animals and fruits.’ These effects
are shown in the left upper quadrant of Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IX">IX</a></span>, where the ashes
are seen proceeding from the <i>lucidus ignis</i>, the ‘upper fiery firmament’. Two figures are seen, a female semi-​recumbent, who
lifts a fruit to her mouth, and a male figure fully recumbent, on
whose legs a rash is displayed. The trees also in this quadrant show
the effects of the ashes, two of them being denuded of fruit and
foliage.</p>

<p>‘Then I saw that from the <i>ignis niger</i> certain vapours (<i>nebulae</i>)
descended, which withered the verdure and dried up the moisture
of the fields. The <i>purus aether</i>, however, resisted these ashes and
vapours, seeking to hold back these plagues.’ These vapours
may be seen in the right upper quadrant of Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IX">IX</a></span>. They
descend from the <i>ignis niger</i>, attenuate for a space in the <i>purus
aether</i>, and then descend through the other zones on to an
arid and parched land. Here are two husbandmen; one sits
forlornly clasping his axe, while the other leans disconsolately upon
his hoe. On the legs of the latter a rash may be distinguished.</p>

<p>‘And looking again I saw that from the <i>fortis et albus lucidusque
aer</i> certain other clouds reached the earth and infected men and
beasts with sore pestilence, so that they were subjected to many
ills even to the death, but the <i>aer aquosus</i> opposed that influence
so that they were not hurt beyond measure.’ This scene is portrayed
in the right lower quadrant of Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IX">IX</a></span>. Here is a husbandman
in mortal anguish. He has gathered his basket of fruit
and now lies stricken with the pestilence. His left hand is laid
on his heart, while his right hangs listless on his thigh, pointing to
tokens of plague upon his legs. Beyond lies the dead body of a
beast on which a carrion bird has settled.</p>

<p>‘Again I saw that the moisture in the <i>aer tenuis</i> was as it
were boiling above the surface of the earth, awakening the force
of the earth and making fruits to <span class="nowrap">grow.’<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> This happier scene is
represented in the left lower quadrant of Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#IX">IX</a></span>. Here the
beneficent fertilizing influence is falling on trees and herbs and the
happy husbandmen are reaping its results.</p>

<p>The main outline of the <i>Liber Divinorum Operum</i> is, we believe,
borrowed from the work of Bernard Sylvestris of Tours, <span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span><i>De mundi

the gods and goddesses of the classical pantheon flit across the
stage, for all the world as though the writer were a pagan, and the
work might be thought to be the last one from which our pious
authoress would borrow. The <i>De mundi universitate</i> is alternately
in prose and verse and betrays an acquaintance with the classics
very rare at its date. ‘The rhythm of the hexameters is clearly
that of Lucan, while the vocabulary is mainly of <span class="nowrap">Ovid.’<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> The
mythology is founded mainly on the <i>Timaeus</i>. The eternal <i>seminaria</i>
of created things are mentioned, and it has been conjectured
that the work exhibits traces of the influence of <span class="nowrap">Lucretius,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> but
the general line of thought is clearly related to Neoplatonic
literature. Thus the <i>anima universalis</i> of Neoplatonic writings
can be identified with the <i>Nous</i> or <i>Noys</i> of Bernard. This principle
is contrasted with primordial matter or <i>Hyle</i>. The parallel character
of the <i>Liber Divinorum Operum</i> and the <i>De mundi universitate</i>
can be illustrated by a few extracts from the latter. It will
be seen that although the general setting is changed, yet Hildegard’s
figure of the spirit of the macrocosm is to be identified with
Bernard’s <i>Noys</i>. <i>Hyle</i>, on the other hand, becomes in Hildegard’s
plan the monstrous form, the emblem of brute matter, on which
the spirit of the universe tramples.</p>

<p>Hildegard’s conception of macrocosm and microcosm, which
was thus probably borrowed from Bernard Sylvestris, has
analogies also to those well-​known figures illustrating the supposed

<p>Hildegard often interprets natural events by means of a
peculiarly crude form of the doctrine, as when she describes how
‘if the excess of waters below are drawn up to the clouds (by the
just judgment of God in the requital of sinners), then the moisture
from the <i>aer aquosus</i> transudes through the <i>fortis et albus lucidusque
aer</i> as a draught drunk into the urinary bladder; and the same
waters descend in an <span class="nowrap">inundation’.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span></p>

<p>Again, events in the body of man are most naively explained on
the basis of the nature of the external world as she has pictured it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The humours at times rage fiercely as a leopard and again

show their diversity by leaping and goring as a stag, or they may
be as a wolf in their ravening, and yet again they may invade the
body of man after the manner of both wolf and crab. Or else
they may show forth their strength unceasingly as a lion, or as
a serpent they may go now softly, now violently, and at times
they may be gentle as a lamb and at times again they may growl
as an angered bear, and at times they may partake of the nature
of the lamb and of the <span class="nowrap">serpent.’<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span></p></div>

(Vision II), and having investigated in detail the structure of
man’s body, the microcosm, in terms of the greater universe
(Vision III), and discussed the influence of the heavenly bodies
on terrestrial events (Vision IV), Hildegard turns to the internal
structure of the terrestrial sphere (Vision V). This vision is
illustrated by the figure in the Lucca MS. reproduced in Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XI">XI</a></span>.</p>

<p>Upon the surface of the earth towards the east stands the
building which symbolizes the <i>aedificium</i> of the church, a
favourite conception
of our authoress. This
church is surmounted
by a halo, whence proceed
a pair of pinions
which extend their
shelter over a full half
of the earth’s circumference.
As for the
rest of the earth’s
surface, part is within
the wide-​opened jaws
of a monster, the Destroyer,
and the remainder
is beneath
the surface of the
ocean. Within the
earth are five parts
analogous, as she
would have us believe,
to the five senses. An eastern clear arc and a western
clouded one signify respectively the excellence of the orient
where Zion is situated, and the Cimmerian darkness of the occidental
regions over which the shadow of the dragon is cast.
Centrally is a quadrate area divided into three zones where
the qualities of heat and cold and of a third intermediate ‘temperateness’
(<i>temperies</i>) are stored. North and south of this are
two areas where purgatory is situate. Each is shaped like a truncated
cone and composed also of three sectors. Souls are seen
suffering in one sector the torment of flame, in another the torment
of water, while in the third or intermediate sector lurk monsters<span class="pagenum hide" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
and creeping things which add to the miseries of purgatory or
at times come forth to earth’s surface to plague mankind.
These northern and southern sections exhibit dimly by their
identically reversed arrangement the belief in the antipodean
inversion of climate, an idea hinted several times in Hildegard’s
writings, but more definitely illustrated by a figure of Herrade de
Landsberg (Fig. 5).</p>

<p>Macrocosmic schemes of the type illustrated by the text of
Hildegard and by the figures of the Lucca MS. had a great vogue
in mediaeval times, and were passed on to later ages. Some
passages in Hildegard’s work read curiously like Paracelsus <span class="nowrap">(1491–1541),<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span>
and it is not hard to find a link between these two difficult
and mystical writers. Trithemius, the teacher of Paracelsus, was
abbot of Sponheim, an important settlement almost within sight of
Hildegard’s convents on the Rupertsberg and Disibodenberg. Trithemius
studied Hildegard’s writings with great care and attached<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
much importance to them, so that they may well have influenced
his pupil. The influence of mediaeval theories of the relation
of macrocosm and microcosm is encountered among numerous
Renaissance writers besides Paracelsus, and is presented to us,
for instance, by such a cautious, balanced, and scientifically-​minded
humanist as Fracastor. But as the years went on, the difficulty
in applying the details of the theory became ever greater and
greater. Facts were strained and mutilated more and more to
make them fit the Procrustean bed of an outworn theory, which
at length became untenable when the heliocentric system of
Copernicus and Galileo replaced the geocentric and anthropocentric
systems of an earlier age. The idea of a close parallelism between
the structure of man and of the wider universe was gradually
abandoned by the scientific, while among the unscientific it
degenerated and became little better than an insane obsession.
As such it appears in the ingenious ravings of the English follower
of Paracelsus, the Rosicrucian, Robert Fludd, who reproduced,
often with fidelity, the systems which had some novelty five
centuries before his time (Figs. <a href="#Fig_06">6</a>, <a href="#Fig_07">7</a>, and 8). As a similar fantastic
obsession this once fruitful hypothesis still occasionally appears
even in modern works of learning and <span class="nowrap">industry.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII. <span class="smcap">Anatomy and Physiology</span></h3>

<p>Hildegard’s ideas on these subjects are set out in the fourth
vision of the <i>Liber Divinorum Operum</i>, which is devoted to a description
of man’s body according to the macrocosmic scheme. This
setting makes her account by no means easy to read, while it
increases the difficulty of tracing the origin of her views.</p>

<p>The list of works containing anatomical descriptions available
to a German writer in the early Middle Ages is not long.
Avicenna was hardly yet accessible, and only such scraps of Galen
as appear in Constantine and the Salernitans. The available
works may be enumerated thus:</p>

<p>Of these seven sources it appears to us that (<i>c</i>) and (<i>f</i>)&mdash;the
short <i>De humana natura</i> of Constantine, and the five-​figure series&mdash;are
those on which Hildegard drew. The absence of Arabisms
and the scarcity of technical anatomical terms in her writings,
her failure to distinguish between veins and arteries, the absence
of anything of the nature of myology or osteology, together with
the neglect of the spinal marrow as an important organ, make it
very unlikely that she consulted Constantine’s longer works or
the Salernitan authorities or the text of the five-​figure series.
Her anatomical descriptions resemble those of Constantine’s shorter
work, on the other hand, in the description of the three vesicles
of the brain and their relations to the faculties of the mind, in
the treatment of the five senses, in the view of the influence of
the planets on the child and the emphasis laid on epilepsy, as well
as in the absence of any distinction between arteries and veins,
and in the loose doctrines of the humours and of the causes of
deformities and monstrosities. In some of these respects also her
account of the human body presents points of resemblance to
the <i>De hominis membris ac partibus</i> of Hugh of St. <span class="nowrap">Victor,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> with
whom, however, her contact appears to be less close than with
Constantine.</p>

<p>We may infer that Hildegard had consulted anatomical
diagrams and was accustomed to this method of representing the
organs from a passage descriptive of the microcosm, in which she
says that ‘in the mouth of the figure in whose body was the disk,
I saw a light brighter than the light of day, in the form of threads,
some circular, some in other geometrical forms, and some shaped
like human members belonging to the figure, which was clearly
portrayed on the disk upright and accurately <span class="nowrap">limned’.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span> These
‘circles and geometrical figures’ fairly describe the highly diagrammatic
manner in which the five-​figure series represents the
internal organs, and several points suggest that she does indeed
refer to this series. Her description of the abdominal muscles<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
(<i>umbilicus</i>) ‘covering the viscera like a cap’, her general descriptions
of the vessels (<i>venae</i>) and the muscles, and especially her
account of the vessels of the leg and of the intimate relations of
the main <i>venae</i> to the organ of hearing, fits in perfectly with
the form of these remarkable diagrams (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a></span>).</p>

<p>We here render some of the most important of her general
anatomical descriptions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The humours may pass to the liver, where wisdom is tested,
having been already tempered in the brain by the strength of the
spirit, and having absorbed its moisture so that now it is plump,
strong, and healthy.</p>

<p>‘In the right of man is the liver and its great heat, so that the
right is swift to act and to <span class="nowrap">work;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> but towards the left are heart
and lung, which fortify the body for its task and receive their
heat from the liver as from a furnace. But the vessels of the
liver, affected by the agitation of the humours, trouble the venules
of the ear of man and sometimes confound the organ of hearing<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>‘I saw also that sometimes the humours seek the navel, which
covers the viscera as a cap, and holds them in, lest they be dissipated,
and maintains their course and preserves the heat both of
them and of the veins<span class="ell">...</span>. But sometimes the humours seek the
loins <span class="nowrap">(<i>lumbos</i>),<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> which mock, deceive, and endanger the virile powers
and which are held in place by nerves and other vessels; in which,
nevertheless, reason nourishes so that man may know what to do
and what to avoid<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>‘And the same humours go to the vessels of the reins and of
other members, and pass in their turn to the vessels of the spleen,
and then to the lungs and to the heart; and they meet the viscera
on the left where they are warmed by the lungs, but the liver
warms the right-​hand side of the body. And the vessels of the
brain, heart, lung, liver, and other parts carry strength to the
reins, whose vessels descend to the legs, strengthening them;
and returning along with the leg vessels, they unite with the
virile organ or with the womb as the case may be.</p>

<p>‘And as the stomach absorbs food, or as iron is sharpened on
a stone, so do they bring the reproductive power to those parts.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Again, the muscles of the arms, legs, and thighs contain
vessels full of humours; and just as the belly has within it
viscera containing nourishment, so the muscles of arms, legs, and
thighs have both vessels and the [contained] humours which
preserve man’s strength<span class="ell">...</span>. But when a man runs or walks
quickly, the nerves about the knees and the venules in the knees
become distended. And since they are united with the vessels
of the legs, which are numerous and intercommunicate in a net-​like
manner, they conduct the fatigue to the vessels of the liver,
and thus they reach the vessels of the brain, and so send the fatigue
throughout the body. But the vessels from the reins pass rather
to the left leg than to the right, because the right leg gets its
strength more from the heat of the liver. And the vessels of the
right leg ascend as far as the renal and kindred vessels, and
these latter vessels unite with those of the kidney. And the
liver warms the reins which lie in the fatness derived from the
humours<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>‘The humours in man are distributed in just measure. But
when they affect the veins of the liver, his humidity is decreased
and also the humidity of the chest is attenuated; so that thus
dried, he falls into disease of such a nature that the phlegm is
dry and toxic and ascends to the brain. There it produces headache
and pain in the eyes and wasting of the marrow, and thus if the
moon is in default he may develop the falling evil [epilepsy].</p>

<p>‘The humidity also which is in the umbilicus is dispersed by
the same humours, and turned into dryness and hardness, so
that the flesh becomes ulcerated and scabby as though he were
leprous, if indeed he do not actually become so. And the vessels
of his testicles, being adversely affected by these humours, similarly
disturb the other vessels, so that the proper humidity is dried
up within them; and thus, the humours being withdrawn, impetigos
may arise <span class="ell">..</span>. and the marrow of the bones and the vessels of the
flesh are dried up, and so the man becomes chronically ill, dragging
out his days in languor.</p>

<p>‘But sometimes the humours affect breast and liver <span class="ell">..</span>. so
that various foolish thoughts arise <span class="ell">..</span>. and they ascend to the
brain and infect it and again descend to the stomach and generate
fevers there, so that the man is long sick. Yet again they vex
the minor vessels of the ear with superfluity of phlegm; or with
the same phlegm they infect the vessels of the lung, so that he
coughs and can scarce breathe; and the phlegm may pass thence
into the vessels of the heart and give him pain there, or the pain
may pass into the side, exciting pleurisy; under such circumstances
also, the moon being in defect, the man may lapse into the
falling <span class="nowrap">sickness.’<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span></p></div>

<p>Sometimes Hildegard’s anatomical ideas can be paralleled
among her contemporaries. Thus the following passage on the
relationship of the planets to the brain is well illustrated by
a diagram of Herrade de Landsberg.</p>

<h3>IX. <span class="smcap">Birth and Death and the Nature of the Soul</span></h3>

<p>The method by which the soul enters the body is set forth in
a very striking vision in the <i>Scivias</i> and is illustrated in the Wiesbaden
Codex B by a no less remarkable miniature (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XIX">XIX</a></span>). The
soul, which contains the element of wisdom, passes into the infant’s
body while yet within the mother’s womb. The <i>Wisdom of God</i> is
represented as a four-​square object, with its angles set to the four
quarters of the earth, this form being the symbol of stability.
From it a long tube-​like process descends into the mother’s womb.
Down this there passes into the child a bright object, described
variously as ‘spherical’ and as ‘shapeless’, which ‘illumines the
whole body’ and becomes or develops into the soul.</p>

<p>The birth scene is strikingly portrayed. In the foreground lies
the mother with the head and shoulders supported and the right
arm raised. In her womb is the infant in the position known to
obstetricians as a ‘transverse presentation’. Around the child
may be distinguished clear traces of the uterine membranes.
Near the couch are ranged a group of ten figures who carry vessels
containing the various qualities of the child. Above and to the
left the Evil One may be seen pouring some noxious substance into
one of these vessels, or perhaps abstracting some element of good.
The whole scene suggests the familiar fairy tale in which, while all
bring pleasant gifts to the child’s birth, there comes at last the old
witch or the ill-​used relative who adds a quota of spitefulness.</p>

<p>The scene is described and expounded as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Behold, I saw upon earth men carrying milk in earthen vessels
and making cheeses therefrom. Some was of the thick kind from
which firm cheese is made, some of the thinner sort from which
more porous [<i>tenuis</i>] cheese is made, and some was mixed with
corruption [<i>tabes</i>] and of the sort from which bitter cheese is
made. And I saw the likeness of a woman having a complete
human form within her womb. And then, by a secret disposition
of the Most High Craftsman, a fiery sphere having none of the
lineaments of a human body possessed the heart of the form, and
reached the brain and transfused itself through all the members<span class="ell">...</span>.
And I saw that many circling eddies possessed the sphere and
brought it earthward, but with ever renewed force it returned
upward and with wailing asked, “I, wanderer that I am, where
am I?” “In death’s shadow.” “And where go I?” “In the
way of sinners.” “And what is my hope?” “That of all <span class="nowrap">wanderers.”’<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span>
The vision is explained as follows: ‘Those whom thou
seest carrying milk in earthen vessels are in the world, men and
women alike, having in their bodies the seed of mankind from
which are procreated the various kinds of human beings. Part is
thickened because the seed in its strength is well and truly concocted,
and this produces forceful men to whom are allotted gifts
both spiritual and carnal<span class="ell">...</span>. And some had cheeses less firmly
curdled, for they in their feebleness have seed imperfectly tempered,
and they raise offspring mostly stupid, feeble, and useless<span class="ell">...</span>. And
some was mixed with corruption <span class="ell">..</span>. for the seed in that brew
cannot be rightly raised, it is invalid and makes misshapen men
who are bitter, distressed, and oppressed of heart, so that they may
not lift their gaze to higher <span class="nowrap">things<span class="ell">...</span>.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> And often in forgetfulness
of God and by the mocking devil, a <i>mistio</i> is made of the
man and of the woman and the thing born therefrom is deformed,
for parents who have sinned against me return to me crucified in
their <span class="nowrap">children.’<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span> (Compare Constantine <i>De humana natura</i>, sections
‘De perfectione’ and ‘De impeditione’.)</p></div>

<p>Hildegard thus supposes that the qualities and form of a child
are inherited from its parents, but that two factors, the formless
soul from the Almighty and the corrupt fluid instilled by the devil,
also contribute to the character of offspring. This is the usual
mediaeval view and is broadly portrayed in the figure.</p>

<p>The strange conception of the body being formed from the seed,
as cheese is precipitated and curdled from milk, is doubtless derived
from a passage in the Book of Job:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Hast thou not poured me out as milk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curdled me like cheese?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knit me together with bones and sinews’ (Job x. 10, 11)<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the body has thus taken shape there enters into it the
soul which, though at first shapeless, gradually assumes the form
of its host, the earthly tabernacle; and at death the soul departs<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
through the mouth with the last breath, as a fully developed naked
human shape, to be received by devils or angels as the case may be
(Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XX">XX</a></span>).</p>

<span class="smcap">Plate</span> XXIII.&emsp;<span class="ls02em">THE VISION OF THE TRINITY</span>
</div>

<p>During its residence in the body the soul plays the part usually
assigned to it in the earlier mediaeval psychology, before the ideas
of Nemesius and Ibn Ghazali had been elaborated and systematized
by Albert and Aquinas. Hildegard regards the brain as having
three chambers or divisions, corresponding to the three parts of
man’s nature, an idea encountered in the writings of St. Augustine.
Parallel to these there are, she tells us,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘three elements in man by which he shows life; to wit, soul
(<i>anima</i>), body (<i>corpus</i>), and sense (<i>sensus</i>). The soul vivifies the
body and inspires the senses; the body attracts the soul and
reveals the senses; the senses affect the soul and allure the body.
For the soul rules the body as a flame throws light into darkness,
and it has two principal powers or limbs, the intellect (<i>intellectus</i>)
and the will (<i>voluntas</i>); not indeed that the soul has limbs to move
itself, but that it manifests itself thereby as the sun declares himself
by his brightness<span class="ell">...</span>. For the intellect is attached to the soul as
the arms to the body: for as the body is prolonged into arms with
fingers and hands attached, so the intellect is produced from the
soul by the operation of its various <span class="nowrap">powers.’<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span></p></div>

<p>We need follow Hildegard no further into her maze of micro-​cosmology,
in which an essential similarity and relationship is
discovered between the qualities of the soul, the constitution of the
external cosmos, and the structure of the body, a thought which
appears as the culmination of her entire system and provides the
clue to the otherwise incomprehensible <span class="nowrap">whole.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span></p>


<h3>X. <span class="smcap">The Visions and their Pathological Basis</span></h3>

<p>For the physical accompaniments and phenomena of Hildegard’s
visions we have three separate lines of evidence: her own
account; the statements of her contemporary biographers, Theodoric
and Godefrid; and the miniatures of the Wiesbaden Codex B,
probably prepared under her supervision.</p>

<p>It is clear that despite the length and activity of her life,
Hildegard did not enjoy normal health. From a very early age
she was the subject of trances and visions, and from time to time
she was prostrated with protracted illness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘God punished me for a time by laying me on a bed of sickness
so that the blood was dried in my veins, the moisture in my flesh
and the marrow in my bones, as though the spirit were about to
depart from my body. In this affliction I lay thirty days while my
body burned as with fever, and it was thought that this sickness
was laid upon me for a punishment. And my spirit also was ailing,
and yet was pinned to my flesh, so that while I did not die, yet did
I not altogether live. And throughout those days I watched
a procession of angels innumerable who fought with Michael and
against the dragon and won the victory<span class="ell">...</span>. And one of them
called out to me, “Eagle! <span class="nowrap">Eagle!<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> why sleepest thou<span class="ell">?..</span>. All
the eagles are watching thee<span class="ell">...</span>. Arise! for it is dawn, and eat
and drink.” And then the whole troop cried out with a mighty
voice<span class="ell">,..</span>. “Is not the time for passing come? Arise, maiden,
arise!” Instantly my body and my senses came back into the
world; and seeing this, my daughters who were weeping around
me lifted me from the ground and placed me on my bed, and thus
I began to get back my strength.</p>

<p>‘But the affliction laid upon me did not fully cease; yet was
my spirit daily strengthened<span class="ell">...</span>. I was yet weak of flesh, timid of
mind, and fearful of pain <span class="ell">..</span>. but in my soul I said, “Lord! Lord!
all that Thou puttest upon me I know to be good <span class="ell">..</span>. for have I not
earned these things from my youth up?” Yet was I assured He
would not permit my soul to be thus tortured in the future <span class="nowrap">life<span class="ell">...</span>.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span>
Thus was my body seethed as in a pot <span class="ell">..</span>. yet gave I thanks to God,
for if this affliction had not been from Him I had surely not lived so
long. But although I was thus tortured, yet did I, in supernal
vision, often repeat, cry aloud, and write those things which the
Holy Spirit willed to put before me.</p>

<p>‘Three years were thus passed during which the Cherubim
pursued me with a flaming sword <span class="ell">..</span>. and at length my spirit
revived within me and my body was restored again as to its veins
and marrows, and thus I was <span class="nowrap">healed.’<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span></p></div>

<p>This illness of Hildegard was the longest and the most typical,
but by no means the only one through which she passed. She
describes her affliction as continuing for long periods, but there can
be little doubt, from her history, that during much of the time
she was able to carry on some at least of her functions as head of
a religious house.</p>

repeated complete recoveries, her activity between the attacks, and
the great age to which she lived. At first sight, the long procession
of figures and visions suggests that she might have been the victim
of a condition similar to that of which Jerome Cardan has left us so
complete a personal record. But on reading the books of visions,
the reader will easily convince himself that we are not here dealing
with a dream-​state. The visions are indeed essentially vivid.
‘These visions which I saw’, she repeatedly assures us, ‘I beheld
neither in sleep, nor in dream, nor in madness, nor with my carnal
eyes, nor with the ears of the flesh, nor in hidden places; but
wakeful, alert, with the eyes of the spirit and with the inward
ears I perceived them in open view and according to the will of
God. And how this was compassed is hard indeed for human
flesh to search <span class="nowrap">out.’<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, though the visions exhibit great originality and
creative power&mdash;the reader will often be reminded of William
Blake&mdash;all or nearly all present certain characters in common. In
all a prominent feature is a point or a group of points of light, which
shimmer and move, usually in a wavelike manner, and are most
often interpreted as stars or flaming eyes. In quite a number of
cases one light, larger than the rest, exhibits a series of concentric
circular figures of wavering form; and often definite fortification
figures are described, radiating in some cases from a coloured
area. Often the lights gave that impression of <i>working</i>, boiling
or fermenting, described by so many visionaries, from Ezekiel
onwards.</p>

<p>This outline of the visions the saint herself variously interpreted.
We give examples from the more typical of these
visions, in which the medical reader or the sufferer from migraine
will, we think, easily recognize the symptoms of scintillating
scotoma. Some of the illuminations, here reproduced in their
original colours, will confirm this interpretation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I saw a great star most splendid and beautiful, and with it an
exceeding multitude of falling sparks which with the star followed
southward. And they examined Him upon His throne almost as
something hostile, and turning from Him, they sought rather the
north. And suddenly they were all annihilated, being turned into
black coals <span class="ell">..</span>. and cast into the abyss that I could see them no
<span class="nowrap">more’<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span> (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXI">XXI</a></span>).</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span></p>
<p>This vision, illustrated by the beautiful figure of stars falling
into the waves, is interpreted by her as signifying the <i>Fall of the
Angels</i>.</p>

<p>The concentric circles appear in numerous visions, and notably
in that of the <i>Days of the Creation of the World and the Fall of
Man</i>, illustrated by what is perhaps the most beautiful of all the
miniatures of the Wiesbaden Codex B (lib. ii, vis. 1, Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXII">XXII</a></span>).
It is in this concentric form that Hildegard most frequently
pictures the Almighty, and the idea again appears in the eleventh
miniature, here reproduced in its original colours, which she
describes as ‘a most shining light and within it the appearance of
a human form of a sapphire colour which glittered with a gentle but
sparkling glow’ (lib. ii, vis. 2, Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXIII">XXIII</a></span>). Appearances of this
type are recorded again and again.</p>

<p>The type with fortification figures is encountered in a whole
series of visions, of which we reproduce the account and illumination
of the <i>Zelus Dei</i> (lib. iii, vis. 5, Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXIVb">XXIV</a></span>, lower section).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I looked and behold a head of marvellous form <span class="ell">..</span>. of the colour
of flame and red as fire, and it had a terrible human face gazing
northward in great wrath. From the neck downward I could see
no further form, for the body was altogether concealed <span class="ell">..</span>. but the
head itself I saw, like the bare form of a human head. Nor was
it hairy like a man, nor indeed after the manner of a woman,
but it was more like to a man than a woman, and very awful to
look upon.</p>

<p>‘It had three wings of marvellous length and breadth, white
as a dazzling cloud. They were not raised erect but spread apart
one from the other and the head rose slightly above them <span class="ell">..</span>. and
at times they would beat terribly and again would be still. No
word uttered the head, but remained altogether still, yet now and
again beating with its extended wings.’</p></div>

<p>From the head extended a series of fortification lines, and this
peculiar form of vision is reproduced on several occasions and
variously interpreted (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXIVa">XXIV</a></span>, upper section). It is united
with similar visions in what we regard as a reconstructed conception
of exceedingly complex structure. This she claims to see
separately, and she interprets it as the <i>aedificium</i> of the city
of God (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXV">XXV</a></span>). Such reconstructed visions are clearly of a
different type and origin to the simple group in which a shining
light or group of lights is encountered and interpreted as a speaking
figure.</p>

<p>Hildegard’s visions, perhaps without exception, contain this
element of a blinding or glittering light, which she interprets in
a more or less spiritual manner. We terminate our account with
the passage in which she sums up her experiences of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘From my infancy’, she says, ‘up to the present time, I being
now more than seventy years of age, I have always seen this light
in my spirit and not with external eyes, nor with any thoughts of
my heart nor with help from the senses. But my outward eyes
remain open and the other corporeal senses retain their activity.
The light which I see is not located but yet is more brilliant than
the sun, nor can I examine its height, length, or breadth, and I name
it the “cloud of the living light”. And as sun, moon, and stars are
reflected in water, so the writings, sayings, virtues, and works of
men shine in it before me. And whatever I thus see in vision the
memory thereof remains long with me. Likewise I see, hear, and
understand almost in a moment and I set down what I thus learn<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>‘But sometimes I behold within this light another light which
I name “the Living Light itself”<span class="ell">...</span>. And when I look upon it
every sadness and pain vanishes from my memory, so that I am
again as a simple maid and not as an old <span class="nowrap">woman<span class="ell">...</span>.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span></p>

<p>‘And now that I am over seventy years old my spirit according
to the will of God soars upward in vision to the highest heaven and
to the farthest stretch of the air and spreads itself among different
peoples to regions exceeding far from me here, and thence I can
behold the changing clouds and the mutations of all created things;
for all these I see not with the outward eye or ear, nor do I create
them from the cogitations of my heart <span class="ell">..</span>. but within my spirit,
my eyes being open, so that I have never suffered any terror when
they left <span class="nowrap">me.’<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span></p></div>

<h2>JOHN WILFRED JENKINSON</h2>

<p>John Wilfred Jenkinson was born in 1871, and came from
Bradfield to Exeter College, Oxford, with a classical scholarship
in 1890. After taking his degree in <i>Literae Humaniores</i> he came,
in 1894, to University College, London, where he devoted himself
with extraordinary and never-​flagging energy to biological studies.</p>

<p>Without having had the usual preliminary scientific teaching,
he brought, on the other hand, a well-​trained mind to bear on his
new work, and the rapidity and completeness with which he acquired
his scientific equipment was one of the most striking and
interesting points in his career. Jenkinson very soon turned to
original investigation, and from the first he showed a predilection
for Embryology.</p>

<p>For a short time he held a post at one of the great London
hospitals, but he soon returned to Oxford to join the teaching
staff of the Department of Comparative Anatomy. He used the
opportunity of University vacations to work in the laboratory of
the late Professor A.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;W. Hubrecht at Utrecht, where part of his
first published research was written. During the fifteen years of
life that remained to him, he established himself as the foremost
English writer on Embryology, devoting himself especially to its
experimental aspect, a line of work in which he will rank as one of
the pioneers.</p>

<p>Jenkinson became Doctor of Science in 1905, and in the same
year he married Constance Stephenson. In 1906 he was appointed
University Lecturer in Embryology, and in 1909 he was elected
to a Research Fellowship at Exeter College.</p>

<p>Jenkinson’s mind was not of the type that matures early, but
one felt in him a power of solid intellect that gained in force
from year to year. The gap in the ranks of British Science caused
by his death has been generally recognized, but his loss seems
greatest to those personally acquainted with him, who know that
he had by no means reached the zenith of his powers.</p>

<p>Jenkinson led a single-​minded and unselfish life, wholly free
from worldly and ignoble ambitions. Of simple and winning
humour, happy in his domestic life and absorbed in his studies, he
represented the very best type of scientific worker.</p>

<p>He was gifted with a powerful physique, and on the outbreak
of war he became an ardent member of the Oxford Volunteer<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
Training Corps. His qualities of calm courage and high sense of
duty marked him out as a valuable officer. Although forty-​three
years of age, he took a commission in the 12th Worcester Regiment
in January, 1915, and was promoted Captain in the following
April. On May 10 he left for the Dardanelles, having been selected
for service with the 2nd Royal Fusiliers. He was killed in action
on June 4, only ten days after his arrival at the Gallipoli peninsula.</p>

<h2>VITALISM</h2>

<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">By J.&nbsp;W. Jenkinson</span></p>

<p>In one of the oldest biological treatises in the world, the soul or
life of an organism is defined in the most general way as an activity
of a natural organic living body&mdash;ἐντελέχεια σώματος φυσικου̑ ὀργανικου̑
δυνάμει ζωὴν ἔχοντος&mdash;life being autonomous nutrition and
growth and decay. The activity may, however, be latent or patent,
passive or active, sleeping or waking, without losing its peculiar
characters. It is substance (οὐσία), but substance as ‘form’ as
opposed to the material substance of the body, and the living body
is therefore also a substance in a double sense.</p>

<p>It is not identical with the body; but as form, proportion (λόγος),
activity (ἐνέργεια), essence (τὸ τί ἠν εἰναι), it is related to the body,
mere matter (ὕλη), and potentiality (δύναμις) in just the same way
as the seal is related to the wax; and the body is the instrument
whereby it effects its purposes; though subsequent in time, it is
prior in thought to the body, as all activities are to the materials
with which they operate.</p>

<p>At the same time neither it nor its parts are separable from the
body, with the exception, possibly, of mind (νου̑ς); it is indeed
the actual or possible functioning of the body, like the seeing of
the eye or the cutting of the axe, and with the disappearance
of the capacity of this functioning the soul itself also perishes.
Lastly, it is a cause (ἀρχὴ καὶ αἰτία) in a triple sense: first, as the
source of motion; secondly, as that for the sake of which the body
exists; and thirdly, as its essence (οὐσία) or formal cause. The soul
or life is of several kinds, which form together an ascending series
each member of which is necessarily involved in those above it.</p>

<p>The lowest is the nutritive soul (θρεπτική), found in all living
things, and the only soul possessed by plants. It is defined as
motion in respect of nutrition, decay, and growth, processes which
involve alteration (ἀλλοίωσις) in the body; and its functions (ἔργα)
are to utilize food for the maintenance and reproduction of the
form of the body, and to control and limit growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span></p>

<p>The second is the perceptive soul (αἰσθητική), the possession of
which distinguishes animals from plants. This also is a kind of
alteration (ἀλλοίωσις τίς) and consists in being moved and affected.
The fundamental and indispensable perception is touch (ἁφή), for
it is concerned in the acquisition of the food. It is invariably
present: the others may or may not, some or all, coexist with it.</p>

<p>Thirdly, some animals are possessed of a capacity for locomotion,
and the performance of this function requires again a special kind
of soul.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the reasoning soul (διανοητικά) or mind (νου̑ς).
This is found in man alone, unless there be other beings similar to
him, or even nobler than he. Mind alone is eternal and separable
from the body.</p>

<p>Though the observation and experiment of modern science
would doubtless find much to alter in the details of these simple
definitions, yet it must be conceded that, by what is certainly
a most fortunate guess if it is not the most wonderful insight,
Aristotle has laid his finger on the cardinal point of modern physiological
doctrine. For, putting aside for the moment the mental
faculties, it is here laid down in the clearest manner that not only
the functions of growth and decay, nutrition, and reproduction, but
also the capacity of responding to stimuli are to be ultimately
resolved into some kind of movement of the particles of which the
body is composed. Life, in short, as we might say with Virchow,
is a mode of motion.</p>

<p>The biology of to-day distinguishes living from inanimate
bodies by the possession and exercise of the three principal properties
or functions of metabolism, irritability, and reproduction;
and further, the body which performs these functions is not only
composed of chemically complex substances&mdash;proteids&mdash;which are
not found in things that are not alive, but possesses a structure.
In no case, even the simplest, is the organism a mere homogeneous
lump of protoplasm, but it has parts or organs, visibly
different from one another, and obviously correlated with the
activities appropriated to each; and it is the preservation of that
structure, in the individual and in the race, which is the end
towards which the collective performance of all these functions, or
the life of the organism, is apparently directed.</p>

<p>Some of these peculiarities are shared by certain things that are
not commonly regarded as alive. Crystals have of course a definite<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
structure; they can divide, and when broken they can make good
the missing part, but they do not assimilate to the substance of
their own bodies a food-​material which is less complex than it, and
they are not irritable.</p>

<p>The differences, indeed, between the living and the lifeless are
so profound, that it is not to be wondered at that there should have
been in all ages natural philosophers who have held that living
activities are phenomena <i>sui generis</i>, differing <i>toto caelo</i> from the
properties exhibited by lifeless bodies, and never by any conceivability
to be expressed in terms of these.</p>

<p>This doctrine is vitalism.</p>

<p>It exists in several varieties, but one at least is of very ancient
lineage and can be traced back through mediaeval times to the
biological speculations of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Whether Aristotle really held the vitalistic views which have
since been attributed to him is a matter we shall have to discuss
later on, but it is certain that in the writings of Galen there is to be
found a theory of life which bears the stamp of Aristotelian influence,
and was destined to hand that influence on to future generations.
Galen admits the sensitive soul of Aristotle as the peculiarity of
animals, and the rational soul for man, but substitutes for the
nutritive soul certain works of nature&mdash;attraction, repulsion,
retention, alteration. And further, the rational soul is no longer
immortal, but perishable, and is dependent on the body, where
its seat is in the brain; it is material or quasi-​material, a πνευ̑μα,
most efficient when dry.</p>

<p>After a long interval this doctrine reappears in the sixteenth
century in the writings of Vesalius, who tells us that the heart has
a vital soul, the liver a natural soul, while there is elaborated in the
ventricles of the brain an animal spirit or principal soul.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the conception of life as something
material had been discarded by Paracelsus for the belief that the
soul, or as he called it, the ‘Archaeus’, by which the chemical processes
of the body are governed, is not a material but a spiritual
force, a view restated by Stahl more than a hundred years afterwards.
‘The events of the body’, says this author, ‘may be rough-​hewn
by chemical and physical forces, but the soul will shape them
to its own ends, and will do that by its instrument, motion.’</p>

<p>This, of course, is vitalism, and vitalism in its extreme or
‘animistic’ form. The idea recurs later on in the biology of<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
Treviranus. To be living is to have a soul, he tells us, and the
conscious <i>Lebenskraft</i> employs the forces of the material world to
form the organism. ‘Das Weitzenkorn hat allerdings Bewusstsein
dessen, was in ihm ist und aus ihm werden kann, und
träumt wirklich davon.’ Though he adds quaintly enough, ‘Sein
Bewusstsein und seine Träume mögen dunkel genug sein’. It is
curious to observe the revival, at the beginning of the twentieth
century, of this mediaeval mysticism in the speculative writings
of so accomplished an experimentalist as Hans Driesch.</p>

<p>Driesch is an embryologist who in his earlier days had enunciated
an invaluable analytical theory of development, a theory
which suggests that while the formation of the first or elementary
organs that appear in the embryo or larva&mdash;such structures as the
larval gut or sense-​organ, or the germ-​layers&mdash;depends upon the
presence in the germ of certain specific organ-​forming substances
(and this is a fact which has since been abundantly demonstrated
by experiment), the origin of parts that appear later in development
may be accounted for by the action of the first-​formed structures
upon one another, these actions being in the nature of physiological
responses to stimuli; and for this also some evidence has been
produced. On this view differentiation is a mechanical process, set
in motion by fertilization or some other cause, and, given a certain
initial structure of the germ or ovum, given the presence in it of
a certain number of parts or substances capable of acting upon one
another with a fixed co-ordination or harmony of the stimuli and
the responses, given further a proper constitution of the external
environment, then a definite result must follow, the production of
an organism which is like the parents that gave it birth.</p>

<p>But in his later treatises this hypothesis has been repudiated,
and, by a remarkable <i>volte-​face</i>, replaced by a dogma of a wholly
different kind. For now it is urged that no merely material factors
can possibly account either for the harmony of development&mdash;the
due co-ordination of mutually reacting parts; or for the secondary
harmony of composition&mdash;the formation of complex organs by the
union of tissues; or for the functional harmony seen in the activities
of the adult.</p>

<p>For example, it is asserted that any fragment of an egg of
a sea-urchin, if not too small (not less than <span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">32</span></span></span> of the egg), can give
rise to a whole and normal larva. We are told that the cells of
the segmented ovum may be disarranged to any extent by various<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
means, such as raising the temperature, diluting the sea-water,
removing the calcium from the sea-water, or by shaking, without
prejudice to the ultimate normality of development. Each part of
the ovum can therefore, according to the needs of the case, give
rise to any part of the resulting organism. ‘Jeder Teil kann nach
Bedürfniss jedes.’</p>

<p>And thirdly, when the gastrula of a sea-urchin is transversely
divided into two, each half, it is stated, develops into a diminished
whole larva in which the gut becomes divided into the characteristic
three regions, and all the other organs are formed in correct
proportion.</p>

<p>For each of these acts of development in the whole uninjured
larva an explanation may conceivably be given in terms of formative
stimuli exerted by the originally distinct parts of the egg and
calling forth responses in other parts. A mechanism may be
thought of which, when set in motion, will achieve a certain end in
accordance with its own pre-​established harmony; but a mechanism
which can be subdivided <i>ad libitum</i>, or almost <i>ad libitum</i>, and the
parts of which will still achieve the same end, will still behave as
wholes with their parts co-ordinated in the same ratio, temporally
and spatially! Such a mechanism is inconceivable; for to
ensure the uniform result, the relative amounts and positions of
the necessary substances must be imagined as identical in every
possible fragment of the egg that is not too small. Something
is therefore required to superintend, to co-ordinate the causes of
development in the case not only of the part but of the whole
egg as well; and this something is not material. A corroborative
proof of the inadequacy of the purely material explanation&mdash;the
causal explanation in the ordinary sense of the phrase&mdash;may be
derived from a consideration of certain other vital processes. The
facts of acclimatization and immunity betray an extraordinary
adaptability of the organism to a change in its environment;
an organ will adapt itself structurally to an alteration, quantitative
or qualitative, of function [Roux’s ‘Functional Adaptation’]; lost
parts can be regenerated; and then there is the physiology of the
nervous system.</p>

<p>In all these cases of ‘regulation’&mdash;and indeed in all other
responses to stimuli&mdash;the same element, inexplicable in chemical
and physical terms, exists and must exist in development. This
entity is not a form of energy, but a vital constant, analogous to<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
the constants or ultimate conceptions of mechanics and physics
and chemistry and crystallography, but not reducible to these,
just as these cannot be translated into one another.</p>

<p>Driesch describes it as a rudimentary feeling and willing, a
‘psychoid’, ‘morphaesthetic’ or perceptive of that form which
is the desired end towards which it controls and directs all the
material elements of differentiation, like the grain of wheat of
Treviranus, dreaming dimly of its destiny. It is thus a <i>vera causa</i>&mdash;an
unconditional and invariable antecedent&mdash;a psychical factor
which can intervene in the purely physical series of causes and
effects, and for it he revives the Aristotelian term ‘Entelechy’.</p>

<p>Such is the ‘vitalism’ introduced by Hans Driesch, a teleological
theory clearly, but no mere metaphysical doctrine of final
causes: rather a dynamic teleology which not only sees an end in
every organic process, but postulates an immaterial entity to guide
the merely mechanical forces towards the realization of that end.</p>

<p>Such a theory is open to very serious criticism from both the
scientific and the philosophical side. But before we pass to that
criticism let us turn aside to examine some of the other aspects
under which the Proteus of Vitalism presents himself.</p>

<p>Thus the modern physiologist Bunge, while owning that it would
be a lack of intelligence to expect to make with our senses discoveries
in living nature of a different order to those revealed to us
in inorganic nature, yet insists that we must transfer to the objects
of our sensory perception, to the organs, to the tissue elements,
and to every minute cell, something which we have acquired from
our own consciousness, something, that is to say, which is not
motion, and is not in space, but is in time only.</p>

<p>The essence of vitalism, so Bunge would have it, lies in starting
from what we know, the internal world, to explain what we do not
know, the external world. We can only remark that this position
appears to rest upon an epistemological confusion, for Bunge has
evidently failed to distinguish between the idealism which teaches
that the world of nature, including our own bodies, only exists in
so far as it is an object of knowledge, that reality is ultimately
ideal, and the ‘animism’ which, as we have seen, gives every object,
at least every living object, in nature a directive consciousness of
its own. The former does not lie immediately within the scope of
the present inquiry; the latter we shall have occasion to discuss
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span></p>

<p>How far the tenets of animism are to be attributed to Johannes
Müller is not very clear. For while Müller maintained that an
organism is due to an idea which regulates its structure, is the
cause of its harmony, and is in action in the organism itself,
exerting on it a formative power, yet he held that the process was
unconscious. Müller indeed distinguished explicitly between the
vital and the mental or conscious principle, for in the operations
of the former the manifestation of design is the result of necessity,
not of choice. At the same time the two resemble one another
in being homogeneous, in existing throughout the mass of the
organism which they animate, and in being divided together with
the organism (as in regeneration) without suffering any diminution
or change of their powers.</p>

<p>In this conception of the unconscious idea there may possibly
be some confusion between the formal and the final cause, between
the idea of the end to be realized, present at the beginning in the
mind of the artificer, and the end itself. The former is animism:
the latter is sound enough as metaphysics, but is not science at all.</p>

<p>There is still another school of vitalists which, while not going
so far as to commit itself to a belief in a ‘psychoid’, yet proclaims
in no uncertain voice the autonomy of the organism, and not content
with the assertion that at present we have not succeeded in
reducing the activities of the organism to chemical, physical,
and mechanical processes, maintains the utter futility of such
endeavour, and pronounces over the hidden mysteries of life an
eternal <i>Ignorabimus</i>.</p>

<p>Some such view as this we must, I think, attribute to
Dr. Haldane. ‘In biology’, he says, ‘the phenomena which are or
ought to be observed from the very beginning are not physical and
chemical phenomena as self-​existent events, but these phenomena
as expressions of the activity of living organisms. It is the living
organism, and not the physical phenomenon, which is the reality
for biology.’ His belief in organic autonomy is based on the
physiology of metabolism, secretion and absorption, the circulation
of the blood, and the nervous system. Thus in discussing the blood,
after pointing to the constancy in its volume and composition, he
proceeds: ‘Neither starvation nor ingestion of food and drink
materially affect it: liquid injected into it is got rid of with remarkable
rapidity; and any loss of blood by bleeding is soon replaced.
This vital metabolism of the circulatory system is doubtless due<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
chiefly to the activity of its lining endothelium, which most certainly
does not play the mere mechanical part which has often
been attributed to it. The other so-called “mechanisms” can
likewise be shown to have all the characteristics of the living body,
inasmuch as they actively maintain their structure, just as the
organism as a whole does so. There is thus no warrant for calling
them mechanisms, and thus ignoring what is one of their essential
characteristics.’ In passages such as these we seem to catch an
echo of Müller’s unconscious idea, and again we ask ourselves, Are
we dealing with a final or a formal cause? Indeed, Dr. Haldane
insists that his ground conception is teleological.</p>

<p>There is still one other vitalistic theory to which we must allude,
although its interest is now merely historical. This is the belief in
a special vital material, unlike the material of which lifeless bodies
are composed, and endowed with a special vital force, different from
but co-ordinate with the forces of mechanics and physics.</p>

<p>In his <i>Histoire Générale des Animaux</i> Buffon, after referring to
the obvious peculiarities of animals and vegetables&mdash;that their
actions are directed to an end, the conservation of a durable
species&mdash;proceeds to elaborate a thesis in which it is held that
they are composed of organic germs, and that germs of the same
kind are distributed throughout nature, lifeless as well as living.
When an animal or plant dies, its body is dissolved into these
germs, which are then scattered abroad; when it assimilates, it is
by separating these ubiquitous particles from the brute inorganic
portion of the food. The former is utilized for its own growth, the
latter it gets rid of by evacuation and excretion. Lifeless matter
is therefore never converted into living material.</p>

<p>Another advocate of the doctrine of a vital force, a property of
the tissues of the body, and at perpetual war with those inorganic
forms which tend to their destruction, was the physiologist Bichat,
Such a conception as this could not of course survive the rise of
modern chemistry. Its death-​knell was sounded when Lavoisier
and Laplace showed that the bodies of organisms were composed of
the same elements as are found in inanimate nature, and it has long
since passed into the limbo of discredited speculations.</p>

<p>Apart from this, vitalistic theories would appear to be in the
main of two kinds.</p>

<p>First, there is the metaphysical vitalism which tells us we can
never explain the living in terms of the lifeless, insists on the per<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>manent
separation of the sciences of biology on the one hand from
chemistry and physics on the other, and preaches the autonomy
of the organism without venturing to tell us in what that autonomy
consists.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the psychological theory of animism which
posits an autonomous psychical entity to preside over the chemical
and mechanical operations of the body, whether already formed or
in process of development, and to direct them towards its own ends,
the conservation and reproduction of that body’s specific form.</p>

<p>A third party, halting between two opinions, suggests an unconscious
idea, without, however, clearly explaining whether this is to
be taken in a metaphysical or a psychological sense. Frankly
opposed to vitalism in all its forms is the conception of the living
body as a mechanism. This has also an honourable ancestry
behind it. How far the biology of Aristotle is to be looked upon
as mechanistic we shall presently have to inquire, but in Galen
the soul is certainly material, or quasi-​material, as we have already
observed. It is, however, in the physiology of Descartes that
mechanism first appears unmistakably in its modern guise.</p>

<p>For Descartes the body is simply an earthly machine. The
nerves are tubes up which&mdash;in sensation&mdash;the animal spirits flow
to the brain only to be reflected (whence our term reflex action)
down other tubes to the muscles.</p>

<p>‘All the functions of the body’, he tells us, ‘follow naturally
from the sole disposition of its organs, just in the same way that the
movements of a clock or other self-​acting machine or automaton
follow from the arrangement of its weights and wheels. So that
there is no reason on account of its functions to conceive that there
exists in the body any soul, whether vegetative or sensitive, or any
principle of movement other than the blood and its animal spirits
agitated by the heat of the fire which burns continually in the heart
and does not differ in nature from any of the other fires which are
met with in inanimate bodies.’</p>

<p>The rational soul, the soul which thinks, that is, understands,
wishes, imagines, remembers, and feels, is not material. Yet it
always acts through the machine, though that machine can go on
perfectly well without the soul. ‘When the body has all its organs
properly arranged for a particular movement it has no need of the
soul to carry them out. All movements, even those which we call
voluntary, depend principally on the same disposition of the organs.
<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>One and the same cause renders the dead body unfit to produce the
movements and leads the soul to quit the body.’</p>

<p>The biology of Descartes appears to have been accepted by
contemporary physiologists like van Helmont and Borelli, and
certainly commended itself to another philosopher of eminence,
Leibnitz. Like Descartes, Leibnitz also affirms that the body is
a machine or natural automaton; unlike Descartes, however, he
refuses to believe that the mind directs the machine in any way.
Rather there is a complete series of psychical parallel to a complete
series of physical events, and between the two a pre-​established
harmony.</p>

<p>Although the details of Cartesian physiology have long since
been exploded, yet the mechanical principle which that philosophy
enunciated so clearly has persisted and has indeed proved to be
the rock on which modern physiological science has been built.
For, when once the chemists had discovered animal and plant
structure to be composed of elements found in lifeless bodies, and
had proved that compounds found only in the organism could yet
be synthesized <i>in vitro</i>, there was no longer any reason why the
properties of the compounds should be considered as of a different
order to the properties of their component elements. A method
applicable to one was applicable to the other, and as Claude
Bernard has put it, mechanical, physical, and chemical forces are
the only effective agents in the living body, and they are the only
agencies of which the physiologist has to take account.</p>

<p>The substances of which the living body is made up are no
doubt extremely complex, yet none the less&mdash;to quote a more
recent writer, Verworn&mdash;‘physiology is in the last resort the
chemistry of the proteids’. This is the principle that has now for
nearly a century guided and stimulated research into the functions
of the organism: to this principle physiologists, too numerous to
name, have not been ashamed to subscribe: under its banner
some of the proudest triumphs of the science have been won.
Yet it is precisely this which modern or neo-​vitalism has challenged
and asks us to relinquish in favour of a theory of psychoids
or a pseudo-​metaphysical view of life.</p>

<p>The vitalistic position may be assailed from two points, the
scientific and the philosophical.</p>

<p>In the first place the vitalist asserts that mechanism is inadequate
to explain the phenomena of metabolism, of transmission of<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
nervous stimuli, or of development. It is upon the last of these
that Driesch lays special stress.</p>

<p>He has urged, as we have seen, that although a mechanical
explanation might be given (such an explanation has indeed been
put forward by himself) of the specific differentiation of the
organism by supposing the first-​formed elementary organs, developed
out of the substances given in the initial structure of the
germ, to act and react upon one another in accordance with a certain
harmony, provided for by the same structure; yet a mechanism
which can be subdivided <i>ad libitum</i> or almost <i>ad libitum</i>, and
each part of which will still give rise to a complete organism, is not
to be conceived. The answer to this objection has, however, been
supplied by the experiments of Driesch himself and of many others.
For though it is true that each of the first two, four, eight, or even
in some cases each of the first sixteen cells into which the fertilized
ovum becomes segmented, can, when separated from its fellows,
give rise to a complete organism, yet in all cases there comes a time
when the parts cease to be totipotent and produce not whole but
partial structures.</p>

<p>This invariable restriction of potentialities, which occurs earlier
in some cases than in others, and is not due to mere deficiency
of substance, is not hard to account for.</p>

<p>Those substances on the presence of which in the ovum, as
experiment has taught us, the formation of the elementary organs
of the embryo or larva depends, are arranged in different cases in
different ways: and they certainly may be, and very frequently
are, so distributed that while each of the first four cells contains
a like quantity of each of these specific substances, arranged in it
exactly as they were in the whole ovum, the next division will
sunder these materials in such a way that of the resulting eight
blastomeres four will have more of one of the primary egg-​substances,
less of another; the amounts apportioned to the other
four being in just the inverse ratio of this: and the result will be
a difference in the fate of the cells when they are isolated from one
another. In those of the one group the proportions of the organs
developed out of these substances will not be the same as they are
in the other. This is precisely the result which experiment has
revealed; it is exactly this result which Driesch has ignored, or
rather attempted to explain away.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that to some extent the parts of this<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
mechanism are interchangeable, that it can be subdivided, and that
each part, brought now under new conditions, will still possess the
potentialities of the whole, just as such a mechanism as a rocket,
out of which, under the appropriate stimulus, a certain pattern of
stars is developed, might be subdivided into two or more rockets
of half size or less. There is, however, a limit to this interchangeability,
while if the subdivision be carried beyond a certain point
the totipotence of the parts is lost.</p>

<p>If the number of these organ-forming substances given in the
germ were very large, as large, let us suppose, as the total number
of separately inheritable characters, it might indeed be difficult to
imagine a mechanism divisible into even two totipotent parts.
But from the need for this assumption we are saved by the second
part of Driesch’s own <i>Analytische Theorie</i>, which accounts for
subsequent processes of differentiation by attributing the production
of new parts to the mutual interactions of those that are the
first to appear. For this also experimental evidence, though
meagre, is not lacking, while a close parallel is found in the dependence
of certain bodily functions upon substances&mdash;the hormones
of Professor Starling&mdash;secreted by other organs.</p>

<p>In the second place the vitalist maintains that the processes of
metabolism defy, nay more, always will defy, chemical and physical
analysis. The first part of this statement may be a true description
of the knowledge of to-day, but the existence in the living
body of the same elements as are met with elsewhere, the synthesis
of complex organic substances, the establishment of the equivalence
of the energy which leaves the body as mechanical work or
heat to that which enters it in chemical form in the food, should
surely make us hesitate before abandoning all hope of attaining
to a chemistry of life.</p>

<p>And thirdly, there are physiologists who believe that the complex
phenomena presented to us in the activities of the nervous
system are susceptible of a purely mechanical explanation.</p>

<p>‘A feature’, says Gotch, ‘which more particularly suggests spontaneous
cellular activity is the well-​known fact that centrifugal
discharges may continue after the obvious centripetal ones have
ceased. This is pre-​eminently the case when the central mass is
rendered extremely unstable by certain chemical compounds, such
as strychnine, &amp;c. There are, however, suggestive indications in
connexion with such persistent discharges. The more completely
<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>all the centripetal paths are blocked by severance and other means,
the less perceptible is such persistent discharge, and since nervous
impulses are continually streaming into the central mass from all
parts, even from those in apparent repose, it would seem that could
we completely isolate nerve-​cells, their discharge would probably
altogether cease.’ Even in the hyper-​excitable condition produced
by strychnine the spinal motor nerve cells do not discharge centrifugal
impulses when cut off from the centripetal connexions. The
physiologist, therefore, has ‘definite grounds for believing that, as
far as present knowledge goes, both the production and cessation
of central nervous discharges are the expression of propagated
changes and that these changes reveal themselves as physico-​chemical
alterations of an electrolytic character. The nervous
process, which rightly seems to us so recondite, does not, in the
light of this conception, owe its physiological mystery to a new
form of energy, but to the circumstance that a mode of energy
displayed in the non-​living world occurs in colloidal electrolytic
structures of great chemical complexity.’</p>

<p>To all these considerations we must add the fact that life did
once originate upon this planet from matter which was not alive,
and that even now some inorganic phenomena present at least
remote analogies with certain vital processes. Such are the structure,
the spontaneous division, and the regeneration of crystals.</p>

<p>We turn now to the philosophical objections that may be raised
to vitalistic speculations; and here we must be careful to distinguish
what we may term the psychological from the metaphysical
form of the theory.</p>

<p>Driesch has maintained that the belief in a morphaesthetic
psychoid finds support in the philosophies of Kant and Aristotle.
Let us examine the merits of this claim.</p>

<p>Like the scientists of to-day, Kant, in his <i>Critique of the Teleological
Judgement</i>, lays it down as a rule that the mechanical method,
by which natural phenomena are brought under general laws of
causation and so explained, should in all cases be pushed as far
as it will go, for this is a principle of the determinant judgement.
There are cases, however, in which this alone does not suffice.
The possibility of the growth and nutrition, above all of the reproduction
and regeneration of organisms, is only fully intelligible
through another quite distinct kind of causality, their purposiveness.
Organisms are not mere machines, for these have simply<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
moving power. Organisms possess in themselves formative power
of a self-​propagating kind, which they communicate to their
materials. They are, in fact, natural purposes, both cause and
effect of themselves, in which the parts so combine that they are
reciprocally both end and means, existing not only by means of one
another but for the sake of one another and the whole. The whole
is thus an end which determines the process, a final cause which
brings together the required matter, modifies it, forms it, and puts
it in its appropriate place. Such purposiveness is internal, for the
organism is at once its own cause and an end to itself, not merely
a means to other ends, like a machine whose purposiveness is
relative and whose cause is external.</p>

<p>Such is the principle of the teleological judgement. It is a
heuristic principle rightly brought to bear, at least problematically,
upon the investigation of organic nature, by a distant analogy
with our own causality according to purposes generally, and indispensable
to us, as anatomists, as a guiding thread if we wish to
learn how to cognize the constitution of organisms without aspiring
to an investigation into their first origin.</p>

<p>Could our cognitive faculties rest content with this maxim of the
reflective judgement it would be impossible for them to conceive of
the production of these things in any other fashion than by attributing
them to a cause working by design, to a Being which would
be productive in a way analogous to the causality of intelligence.
Natural science, however, needs not merely reflective but
determinant principles which alone can inform us of the possibility
of finding the ultimate explanation of the world of organisms
in a causal combination for which an understanding is not explicitly
assumed, since the principle of purposes does not make the
mode of origination of organic beings any more comprehensible.
And then, in a passage remarkable for its prophetic insight, Kant
proceeds to show how this might be. This ‘analogy of forms’, he
says, ‘which with all their difference seem to have been produced
according to a common original type, strengthens our suspicion
of an actual relationship between them in their production from
a common parent, through the gradual approximation of one genus
to another&mdash;from those in which the principle of purposes seems
to be best authenticated, that is from man down to the polype,
and again from this down to mosses and lichens, and finally to the
lowest stage of nature noticeable by us, namely, crude matter’.<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
And so the whole technic of nature, which is so incomprehensible
to us in organized beings that we believe ourselves compelled to
think a different principle for it, seems to be derived from matter
and its powers according to mechanical laws like those by which
it operates in the formation of crystals. A purposiveness must, however,
be attributed even to the crude matter, otherwise it would not
be possible to think the purposive form of animals and plants.</p>

<p>Although there are doubtless in the <i>Critique</i> many obscurities
and inconsistencies, to which we cannot allude now, the general
meaning of Kant’s reflections upon organisms is perfectly clear.
He who would ‘complete the perfect round’ of his knowledge must
think not only in beginnings but in ends. The end in the case
of a living being is apparently plain&mdash;it is the maintenance and
reproduction of its form; the end in the case of the cosmic
process is to be sought in the ethical, or, in Kantian phraseology, the
‘practical’ concept of the freedom of the moral consciousness of man.</p>

<p>Such a position is quite intelligible, philosophically, but the
testimony it brings to the theory of the psychoid is of very doubtful
value, as Driesch is well aware. He complains indeed that Kant’s
teleology is descriptive or ‘static’, rather than ‘dynamic’, as is
perfectly true, except in the case of man, a point of which Driesch
naturally makes the most. There are, no doubt, passages where
Kant speaks of ‘a cause which brings together the required matter,
modifies it, forms it and puts it in its appropriate place’; but against
these must be set the explicit statement ‘that if the body has an
alien principle (the soul) in communion with it, the body must
either be the instrument of the soul&mdash;which does not make the
soul a whit more comprehensible&mdash;or be made by the soul, in which
case it would not be corporeal at all.’ Vitalism can glean small
comfort from this. Let us turn, then, to the second authority.</p>

<p>As we have seen already, the souls or functions of nutrition
and perception are, in the Aristotelian biology, ultimately to be
expressed as alterations or movements of the particles of the body;
mind alone is separable from body and eternal.</p>

<p>In the development of the individual organism the mind comes
in from outside, but the two souls of lower order are present in the
σπέρμα, or κύημα, as Aristotle calls it, which results from the commingling
of the male and female elements, or, as we should say, the
fertilized ovum. The material and efficient causes of development
are not, however, both contributed by each of the parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span></p>

<p>The teaching of Aristotle is that the matter is provided by the
female and the female alone. The egg (or catamenia in mammals)
is described as being mere matter (ὕλη), body (σω̑μα), potentiality
(δύναμις), passive (παθητικόν) and merely quantitative, although
it is true that a sort of soul, the nutritive, is somewhat grudgingly
conceded to it, since unfertilized eggs appear in some sense to be
alive. The male element, on the other hand, provides the principle
of motion (ἀρχὴ τη̑ς κινήσεως) and the form (εἰδος); it is qualitative,
it is activity, it produces the perceptive soul, if it is not itself
that soul, and it is responsible for the ‘correct proportionality’
(λόγος) of the organization. The male element contributes only
motion, but no matter; it acts upon the female element as rennet
acts when it coagulates milk, except that the analogy is incomplete,
since the γονή brings about a qualitative and not merely a quantitative
change in the material on which it operates. To this it
imparts the same kind of motion which itself possesses, the motion
which was present in the particles of the food in its final form from
which it was itself derived. The communication of this motion is
enough to set going the machinery (αὐτόματον); the rest then
follows of itself in proper order.</p>

<p>Lastly, the sperm of the male acts like a cunning workman who
makes a work of art, using heat and cold as the workman uses his
tools: for this heat and this cold could never of themselves&mdash;by
coagulations and condensations&mdash;produce the form of the body as
the older naturalists had supposed, regarding only the efficient and
ignoring the formal and the final cause: for the organic body is not
what it is because it is produced in such and such a fashion, rather it is
because it is to be such and such that it must be developed as it is.</p>

<p>And here lies the kernel of the whole matter. For while Aristotle
has made it perfectly plain that, according to his idea, the soul,
at least its nutritive and perceptive faculties, is to be regarded as
a function of matter and that this function may be ultimately
expressed in terms of movement, and further that development is
a mechanism which is set going by the communication of motion
proceeding from the ‘soul’ of the male element and derivable
eventually from the motions into which the ‘functions’ or ‘soul’
of the parent can be resolved to the mere matter which the female
provides, it is equally evident that he does not regard this mechanical
explanation&mdash;in terms of material and efficient causes&mdash;as
satisfactory or complete. But when we inquire why, he gives us no<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
certain nor consistent answer. On the one hand, there are passages
in which he tells us that there must be something which controls the
material forces and imposes on them a limit and proportionality of
growth; that the soul makes use of them as the artist makes use
of his implements, and such passages are naturally interpreted by
Driesch in the sense of a ‘dynamic’ teleology; it is the ψυχή which
superintends and controls, and the ψυχή is ‘entelechy’.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, however, we are informed that even the proportionality
of the developing parts is simply the outcome of the motion
imparted by the male, which is <i>actu</i> what the female element only
is <i>potentia</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover, it may be questioned whether Aristotle ever intended
to imply more than an ‘analogy with the causality of purpose’
when he uses the figure of the workman and his implements to
illustrate his meaning of the formal cause. The formal cause of
a work of art is an intelligible <i>vera causa</i>; it is the idea in the
mind of the artist antecedent to the execution of the work; but the
formal or final cause of an organism, the end which it apparently
strives to attain, can only be said by a metaphor to be prior in time
to the existence of the organism itself. Prior in thought, however, it
certainly is, for it is only the performance of its functions (ἐντελέχεια)
by the organism complete in all its parts that makes the mere
mechanism of development comprehensible to us; the process,
therefore, exists for the sake of the end. Only as efficient cause
is the soul prior in time; only so far as it is prior in thought can
it be said to be a final cause.</p>

<p>Such a teleology is, it is obvious, indistinguishable in principle
from the position in which Kant leaves us. It is the position
adopted by Driesch himself in his earlier <i>Analytische Theorie</i>, but
abandoned in the <i>Vitalismus</i> in favour of a theory of ‘psychoids’.</p>

<p>Now quite apart from the meaning which Aristotle may or may
not have intended to convey, there are grave objections to this
belief. This ‘psychoid’, to which the name ‘entelechy’ is surely
misapplied, this rudimentary feeling and willing, which is aware of
the form it desires to produce, must be psychically at least as complex
as the phenomena it is designed to account for, and stands,
therefore, as much in need of explanation as they; as Kant has
observed, this will involve us at once in an infinite series of such
entities. In fact it is only a photograph of the problem, and not
a solution at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span></p>

<p>Again, when we ask what the <i>modus operandi</i> of this cause is, we
get no reply either from Driesch or from any other neovitalist.
The objection that the intervention of a psychical cause in a physical
process is unintelligible, an objection which would probably
appeal to many, may be waived, for in the last resort the connexion
between any&mdash;even simple mechanical&mdash;causes and effects is
equally hard to understand.</p>

<p>It may, however, be doubted whether these entities are not
being multiplied beyond necessity, and whether the progress of
science would not be better served by an adherence to a simpler
philosophy. But even when it has discarded the psychoid we
find vitalism still denying the possibility of mechanical explanation,
still preaching the autonomy of the organism. The ‘dynamic’
teleology of Driesch has only disappeared to be replaced by the
metaphysical doctrine of the final cause.</p>

<p>We may point out, perhaps, in passing, that the organism is by
no means as autonomous as might be desired. The end towards
which the creature strives, the maintenance and reproduction of
its own specific form, is not a constant <i>terminus ad quem</i>, for species
are as mortal as individuals: nor is it always achieved; the
autonomy of a worm, which, bisected in a certain way, regenerates
a tail instead of a head, or of a frog, which, after a particular injury,
develops six legs instead of two, has surely renounced its rights.
But, setting this aside, it must be seriously questioned whether any
good purpose is served in biological discussion by decrying the value
of mechanical conceptions or by confounding two distinct orders of
thought. The questions are grave ones: for the issue at stake is
no less than the existence of physiology as the science of the causes
of living activities.</p>

<p>‘Recte ponitur’, said Francis Bacon, ‘vere scire esse per causas
scire.’ The maxim of the great founder of modern inductive
science has been the lode-star of biology in the past, and is still its
watchword to-day. By exact observation and crucial experiment,
utilizing every canon of induction, the activities of the living
organism are to be brought under wide general laws of causation,
which will be, in the first instance, physiological laws&mdash;of response
to stimuli, of metabolism, and of growth: by means of these laws
predictions can be made, and verified as often as we please. But
no bar can legitimately be set to the scope of human inquiry;
the thought process will not rest here, and ultimately it may be<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
possible to state the widest generalizations of biology in chemical
and physical, and these again in purely mechanical terms. The
maintenance and evolution of form in the individual, as well as the
larger evolution of form in the race, become but the final terms in
a far vaster cosmic process, from ‘homogeneity to heterogeneity’.</p>

<p>The idea is, of course, perfectly familiar: it is the analysis of
purely physical causes, carried to its extreme limit. Phenomena
are thought out in terms not of origins merely, but of one origin,
and that one origin is the only mystery that remains. This unification
of the sciences has always been and must still remain the dream
and the faith and the inspiration of the scientific man, and could
such an edifice of the intellect ever be realized, the task of science
would have been completed. Only when this purely deterministic
method has been pushed as far as it will go does science leave off;
only where science leaves off does philosophy begin.</p>

<p>There is an order of time, and there is an order of thought.
Science works in the order of time, and necessarily so: for although
science can never say what constitutes the invariable link between
antecedent and consequent which it terms causal, yet it rightly
speaks of the first as cause, determining the second as effect, since
it is its function to predict from the past which is known to the
future which is not.</p>

<p>But the outlook of philosophy is different. Dissatisfied with
the endless regress of cause and effect, sceptical of first causes and
original homogeneities, out of which by no conceivability could
any heterogeneity have ever been developed, philosophy looks to
the end.</p>

<p>The activities of living organisms at least appear to be directed
to an end; they are apparently purposive, and it is this purposiveness
which lends to biology, though built on the fundamental conceptions
of chemistry and physics, peculiar features of its own, and
is, of course, answerable for the teleological language which biologists
so frequently employ. And by a knowledge of the end, the
view of science, to which <i>qua</i> science it cannot too rigidly confine
itself, will doubtless be supplemented and enlarged.</p>

<p>But, plain and definite though the end of an individual life may
be, the end of the race&mdash;of the human or any other race&mdash;the end
of the universe, are things only to be guessed at, and all we are left
with is an indefinite series of evolving systems emerging out of an
infinite past and fading into an infinite future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span></p>

<p>In the final issue, indeed, the last effect is as delusive an <i>ignis
fatuus</i> as the first cause. The philosophy which has rejected one
must divest itself of the other, and seek its end, if anywhere, in
the logical <i>prius</i> of the mind, which, though last in time, is yet first
in thought, since through it alone can that ordered knowledge of
nature which we call science be born and brought to perfection.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Anatomy in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries</span></h3>

<p>There was little or no progress in the knowledge of anatomy
between the death of Mondino in 1327 and the sixteenth century.
This appears the more remarkable when we recall how widespread
was the practice of dissection during the period. In France, at the
University of Montpellier, public dissections were decreed in the year
<span class="nowrap">1377,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> and Catalonian Lerida followed suit in <span class="nowrap">1391.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> At Bologna,
where dissection had long been customary, it received official recognition
in the University Statutes in <span class="nowrap">1405,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span> and the same event took
place at Padua in 1429. Public anatomies were instituted at the
University of Prague in 1460, of Paris in 1478, and of Tübingen in
<span class="nowrap">1485.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span> For these ‘Anatomies’ the bodies of executed criminals
were usually employed, and therefore the number of subjects
available varied greatly in different <span class="nowrap">localities.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> In addition to<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
these regular dissections, there was certainly a considerable amount
of post-​mortem examination, surreptitious (Plate <span class="nowrap"><a href="#XXVIIIb"><span class="lowercase smcap">XXVIII</span> <i>b</i></a><a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span>), or
even open (Plate <span class="nowrap"><span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXIX">XXIX</a></span><a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span>), long before Benivieni published his

<p>That so much industry was rewarded by so small an increase in
knowledge may probably be attributed to the method adopted.<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
The so-called ‘anatomies’ were conducted in the most formal
manner. Bertuccio, for example, who succeeded Mondino as
professor of Surgery at Bologna, was accustomed, as we learn from
his pupil Guy de Chauliac, to give short systematic anatomical
demonstrations on a fixed and rigid <span class="nowrap">method.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> The occupant of
the chair at this period
was indeed no professor
in the modern sense of
the word. To expound
the tradition of anatomy
as it had reached him was
regarded as the limit of
his duty. Of any attempt
to extend the bounds of
knowledge, of any systematic
endeavour to
correct or improve the
anatomical views of his
predecessors, we find little
or no trace. Indeed, at
Padua it was expressly
laid down in the statutes
that the exposition of
anatomy should follow
the very words of <span class="nowrap">Mondino.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span></p>

<p>Early figures portraying
the teaching of anatomy
(Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXVII">XXVII</a></span> and
Figs. <a href="#Fig_101">1</a>–<a href="#Fig_103">3</a>, <a href="#Fig_105">5</a>) usually show
us a medical doctor sitting
at a desk, well removed
from the subject of dissection,
and reading from his text-book the description of the
part. Meanwhile an assistant, who is usually also a doctor,
performs the actual work of dissection. The professor of<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
Surgery, to whom the teaching of anatomy was entrusted,
stands by with a pointer to indicate the different organs.</p>

<p>Sometimes the professor changes places with the reader at the
desk. In some later MSS. the teacher is figured as himself
handling the body and demonstrating to his pupil (Plate <span class="nowrap"><a href="#XXXa"><span class="lowercase smcap">XXX</span> <i>a</i></a><a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span><span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>

are the work of artists unfamiliar with dissection and with the
teaching of anatomy.</p>

<p>The study of anatomy had to contend with two great difficulties,
want of subjects for dissection, and faith in the written word.</p>

<p>Thus, at Bologna, where it was arranged that every medical
student of over two years’ standing should attend an <i>Anatomy</i> once
a year, no less than twenty students were admitted to see the
anatomy of each man, and thirty to the anatomy of each <span class="nowrap">woman.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span>
This was all the practical instruction received. Some other Universities
had to be content with the cadaver of a single criminal
per annum for the whole body of students.</p>

<p>In the <i>first</i> period during which the human body was dissected
in Europe, the thirteenth century, a certain amount of progress was
certainly made, despite the rarity of subjects. The rebirth of learning
in the thirteenth century was not, however, as favourable to
anatomical progress as might have been hoped. Galen, indeed,
ceased to be a mere name, and the Latin translations of his text, or
of its adumbra in the writings of the Arabians, became ever more
familiar. On the other hand, with more authoritative texts in
their hands, men were but the more inclined to follow the evil
scholastic way, and to trust rather to the written words of the
master than to the evidence of their own senses. Thus it came
about that the <i>second</i> period, which covers the fourteenth and
most of the fifteenth century, was really stationary so far as the
first-​hand knowledge of anatomy was concerned. With the last
decade of the fifteenth century, however, there opens a new and<span class="pagenum hide" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
<i>third</i> period in the history of our subject. From that time dates
the true era of anatomical renaissance, which may be regarded as
continuing until the commencement of modern anatomy with the
great work of Vesalius in 1543.</p>

<p>We have said that throughout the second period, the formal
demonstrations based on the declaimed text of Galen or Avicenna
or Mondino were practically the sole opportunities afforded to
either teacher or pupil for the investigation of the minuter details
of the human frame. But in making this statement concerning the
arrest of anatomical progress, we must expressly exclude the products
of the mighty genius of Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), whose
anatomical researches were without influence, and remained long
<span class="nowrap">unnoticed.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> We must also omit evidence gathered from the work
of such early Renaissance painters as Antonio Pollaiuolo (1429–98)
or Andrea del Verrocchio (1435–88), for these pursued the study
of anatomy in a special field and with a special <span class="nowrap">object.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> Furthermore,
there are a number of artists of similar date of whose
anatomical studies we have no direct evidence, but who yet
outlined the muscles of the nude human figure in such a way as
leads us to suppose that they had investigated the superficial
structures at least of flayed parts. Such is the suggestion of some
of the work of Luca Signorelli (<i>c.</i> 1442–<i>c.</i> 1524), and of Andrea Mantegna
(died 1506). With such reservations, however, it is probably
true that no evidence is forthcoming until the last decade of the
fifteenth century of any advance from the standpoint of <span class="nowrap">Mondino.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span></p>

<p>But if descriptive anatomy developed slowly in the hands<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
of the physicians, the art of graphic representation of anatomical
structures was still more backward. Several groups of anatomical
drawings of mediaeval date have come down to our time, but
examination of them shows that they have been drawn without
direct reference to the human frame. Some of these figures are
of the crude type known as the ‘five-​figure series’ (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXXIII">XXXIII</a></span>),
mere traditional diagrammatic <span class="nowrap">sketches.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> Hardly better or more
instructive are the series of dissections which illustrate certain MS.

Vigevano (Plates <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXXI">XXXI</a></span> and <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXXII">XXXII</a></span>), <span class="nowrap">1345.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> A few sketches representing

never suggest that the draughtsman had before him the structure
which he seeks to depict, and the drawings appear to have been
made in order to illustrate contemporary physiological theory
rather than observed anatomical fact. Even the magnificent
illuminated Dresden Codex of Galen, prepared in France or Flanders
as late as the second half of the fifteenth century, betrays not
the slightest first-​hand knowledge of <span class="nowrap">anatomy.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> Although the<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>

scarcely more faithful to the facts (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXXIV">XXXIV</a></span>).</p>

<p>The spirit of investigation of the artist who perforce went
direct to nature, dissecting with his own hands and observing<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
with his own eyes (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXXVI">XXXVI</a></span>), showed itself indeed far more
fruitful than the tedious <i>ex cathedra</i> methodization of the <span class="nowrap">professor.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span>
Yet the system of the schools needed to be combined
with the freedom of the artist for the production of an effective
anatomical work. What the projected treatise of Marcantonio
della Torre (1473–1506) might have been we may guess from
the anatomical sketches of Leonardo da Vinci (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXXV">XXXV</a></span>), who
was to have been associated with him in the <span class="nowrap">work.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> In the
event, however, the medical schools had to wait yet another
generation before the subject was placed on a sound basis by
André Vesale.</p>

<p>The Mondino pamphlet&mdash;for it is little more&mdash;used since its
author’s death in 1327 as a text-book in the schools of northern
Italy, was first printed in 1478. Not until the last decade of the
fifteenth century did there appear another work bearing evidence
of the hand of a practical anatomist. This was an Italian translation
of Ketham’s <i>Fasciculus medicinae</i>, impressed at Venice in the
year <span class="nowrap">1493.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span> The volume comprises Mondino’s pamphlet and a
collection of other medical tracts that were probably put together
by Giorgio di Monteferrato from the work of a writer of the previous
century, for their contents are traceable to a fourteenth-​century
<span class="nowrap">MS.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> The text is neither original nor remarkable, but the Venice
volume derives its importance from certain figures which appear
in it for the first time.</p>

<p>Two of these plates are of great interest both intrinsically and
also in relation to the history of anatomy. One of them is the
magnificent representation of a dissection scene, which is regarded
as perhaps the finest example of book illustration produced during
the first century of <span class="nowrap">typography<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span> (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXVII">XXVII</a></span>). This work of the<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
‘maître aux dauphins’, as the unknown artist is called by <span class="nowrap">critics,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span>
is doubly interesting, for it is the subject of an experiment in colour
printing, no less than four pigments being laid on by means of
stencils. As early as 1457 the method of stencilling was employed
for colouring the initials of a Psalter, and in 1485 Erhard Ratdolt
in an astronomical work added yellow to the earlier red and black.
The figure from which our plate is taken represents, however, the
first attempt at a complex colour scheme and leads up to the work
of Hugo da <span class="nowrap">Carpi.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span></p>

<p>In this picture the professor, a youthful figure perhaps intended
to represent Mondino himself, is shown standing at a desk which
hides his book. Around a corpse, laid on a trestle table before
him, there cluster a number of men in doctor’s robes. Their
valid faces are sufficient to convince us that the artist is here presenting
us with portraits. One of the listeners has removed his
robe and stands with upturned sleeves and knife in hand, ready to
make the first incision on the direction of the doctor, who points to
the part with a wand held in the left hand. In the impression of 1495
and in those of later date, the book appears above the desk, the
attitudes of the students are somewhat changed, and many other
details are altered. In all these, however, the blocks have been
recut and the result is artistically <span class="nowrap">inferior<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span> (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_103">3</a>).</p>

<p>The second plate from the 1493 Ketham with which we are

These had clearly been sketched from the object, and therefore
this drawing, the first printed figure of its kind, may be said to
introduce the new era for the investigation of the human frame.
The anatomical renaissance had begun. Into a discussion of the
full development of that age we cannot now enter. But the MS.
of Manfredi, with which we have here to deal, was written at the
very dawn of the new era and is itself one of its earliest documents.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Bolognese Works on Anatomy</span></h3>

<p>An organized Medical Faculty existed at Bologna at least as
early as <span class="nowrap">1156,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> though the first record of dissection there is of considerably
later date. In February 1302 a certain Azzolino died
under suspicious circumstances. Poison was suspected, an inquest
was held and a post-​mortem examination ordered. The investigation
was conducted by two physicians and three surgeons, who
unanimously agreed ‘that the said Azzolino assuredly met his
death by no poison, but on the contrary, we assert that the quantity
of blood collected in the great vein known as the <i>vena chilis</i>
[vena <span class="nowrap">cava]<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span> and in the veins of the liver adjacent thereunto,
has prevented the due movement of the <i>spiritus</i> throughout the
body, and has thus produced the diminution or rather extinction
of the innate heat and thereby induced a rapid post-​mortem
discoloration. Of this condition we have assured ourselves <i>by the
evidence of our own senses and by the anatomization of the parts</i><span class="nowrap">.’<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span></p>

<p>The first anatomical document emanating from the University
of Bologna is, however, of still earlier date, and is the work of
William of Saliceto (1210?–80). This writer was educated at
Bologna, and it is claimed that he was the first to dissect the
human body <span class="nowrap">there.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> His <i>Cyrurgia</i>, which was completed in 1275
(<i>editio princeps</i>, Piacenza, 1476), is divided into five books, of
which the fourth and shortest is devoted to anatomy. Its descriptions
are brief and concise. They are often clearly the result of
actual observation, and they show hardly any trace of the absurd
and irritating teleology that the influence of the Arabians and<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
of Galen made customary in early anatomical literature. The
anatomy of Saliceto appears to us very sensible and so far as it goes
practical. It betrays the method rather of the Salernitan than of
the Arabian anatomical writings, and is on the whole the best
European work of the kind before the Renaissance. It was, however,
soon replaced by the text-book of Mondino di Luzzi <span class="nowrap">(1285–1327),<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span>
which, though inferior to that of Saliceto, held the field
until the subject was revolutionized by Vesalius.</p>

Second half of XVth Century</span>
</div>

<p>Mondino was professor at Bologna till his death in 1327. His
work, easily accessible in one of its many editions, ‘is corrupted by
the barbarous leaven of the Arabian schools, and his Latin defaced
by the exotic nomenclature of Avicenna and <span class="nowrap">Rhazes’.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span> But it is
not the language alone that has suffered. The schoolman’s attitude,
well fitted for the classification of ideas, is an ill instrument
for the investigation of Nature, and in the scholastic Mondino the
very basis of scientific judgement is undermined, so that he readily
accepts the views of the ancients against what must often have been
the evidence of his own senses. The work, however useful to the
contemporary student, was thus essentially reactionary as against
the efforts of the earlier Salernitan anatomists and of William of
Saliceto. This is the more remarkable because it is quite clear that
he was accustomed to demonstrate on the actual body&mdash;a privilege
denied to the early Salernitan school,&mdash;and he was, moreover,
a popular and successful teacher. His work is a manual of dissection
rather than a treatise on anatomy. This, added to its
conciseness and brevity, strengthened its appeal to the ‘practical’
man&mdash;an epithet claimed then, as now, by the majority of stupid
and unpractical people. The personal influence and enthusiasm
of its author no doubt helped also towards the phenomenal success
of this work, which for two hundred years held a position without
rival as the text-book of the medical schools of Italy, where even
as late as the sixteenth century Mondino ‘was still worshipped by
all the students as a very <span class="nowrap">god’.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span></p>

<p>Mondino was succeeded in the chair of Surgery at Bologna by
his pupil, the Lombard Bertuccio, who died in the Black Death of
1347. Bertuccio’s surviving work is unnoteworthy, but he was
the anatomical teacher of Guy de Chauliac, whose <span class="nowrap"><i>Surgery</i><a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span> is of
great value and was very influential in standardizing practice,
especially in the north and west of Europe. Nevertheless it
appears to us that the anatomical section is the weakest part of
Guy’s great work. The teleology that is a blot in Mondino has here
become a perfect plague, and Guy’s anatomy consists of one-​third
description and two-​thirds wearisomely reiterated reasons for the
existence of imperfectly described structures. Through Guy de
Chauliac the anatomical tradition of Mondino passed over into the
University of Montpellier.</p>

<p>A later fourteenth-​century Bolognese writer was Tommaso di
Garbo (died 1370), who did little but comment on Avicenna. A
surgeon of the next generation, however, Pietro d’Argellata,
deserves to be remembered for his description of the examination
of the body of Pope Alexander V, who died suddenly at Bologna on
May 4, 1410. His account throws light on the customary procedure
and may be rendered <span class="nowrap">here.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span></p>

<p>‘I ordered the attendants’, he says, ‘first to cut the abdomen
from the <i>pomegranate</i> [i.e. the Adam’s apple or laryngeal <span class="nowrap">cartilage<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span>]
to the os pectinis [i.e. the symphysis pubis]. Then, so that
they should not rupture the intestines, I myself sought the rectum
and ligatured it in two places and then cut it between. Next I
removed all the intestines as far as the duodenum and dealt with
them as with the rectum, and so I had the intestines clean and
without fetor. After this I extracted the liver, seizing its ligaments;
then the spleen and then the kidneys, and these were all
placed together in a jar. I now passed to the spiritual members
[i.e. the thorax] and removed lung and heart and all their ligaments.
Then I ligatured the <i>meri</i> [the Arabian term for oesophagus]
and removed the stomach. When this had been done
there were some who wished to remove the tongue but knew not
how. I however cut under the chin and extracted the tongue
<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>through that hole, together with <i>trachea arteria</i> [trachea] and <i>meri</i>.
Then I passed to the <i>arteria adorti</i> [aorta] and <i>vena chilis</i> [vena
cava]. Lastly I removed the ligatured remnant of the intestines
as far as the anal margin.’</p></div>

<p>Giovanni da Concoreggio (died 1438), who was lector in Surgery
at Bologna in the early part of the fifteenth century, left a few
anatomical observations of little <span class="nowrap">note,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span> and not very much more can
be said for his successors and Manfredi’s contemporaries Gabriele
Gerbi (de Zerbis, died 1505) and Alessandro Achillini (1463–1512).
<span class="nowrap">Gerbi<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span> does little but repeat in the most verbose fashion the
work of Mondino and of Avicenna, some of whose errors, however&mdash;e.g.
the three ventricles of the heart&mdash;he omits. He wrote
also an anatomy of the infant, or rather of the <span class="nowrap">foetus,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span> and a
treatise taken mainly from Avicenna’s <i>De generatione embryonis</i>.
Like all his work, these are in the full scholastic style of a professor
of Logic, a position to which, in fact, he ultimately attained.</p>

<p>Achillini’s <span class="nowrap">work<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span> is but a slight advance on that of Gerbi. It is
really little else than a note-book for students, and gives the baldest
directions for dissection, accompanied by a few comments taken
from Avicenna. Achillini occasionally ventures to criticize Mondino,
and his work has at least the advantage of brevity. He has
a claim to be remembered in that he was the first to describe the
duct of Wharton and is said to have been the first to describe
the ear ossicles, malleus and incus. Achillini, like Gerbi, was
a windy and very ‘scholastic’ disputator. He was best known
to his contemporaries as a supporter of the philosophy of
Averroes. In 1506, when driven from Bologna with the other
supporters of Bentivoglio, he became professor of Philosophy at
Padua.</p>

From Berengar of Carpi’s Commentary on Mondino, Bologna, 1521.
</div>

<p>With Giacomo Berengario da Carpi we come at length to
one who definitely advanced the science, and who may be regarded
as the first modern anatomist, so far as printed works are concerned.
He was professor of Surgery from 1502 to 1527, and during<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
that period published his great anatomical <span class="nowrap">work.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> This volume,
though modestly put forward as a commentary on Mondino, is in
reality an original contribution of great value. It is the earliest
anatomical treatise that can properly be described as having figures
illustrating the text (Fig. 8)<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> Carpi does not hesitate to criticize
the work on which he comments&mdash;as for instance when he denies
the existence of the ‘rete mirabile’ below the brain, though
descriptions of the ‘rete mirabile’ had been based on the statement<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
of no less an authority than Galen. Furthermore he was the
first to describe the vermiform appendix, and he gave the earliest
correct account of several other organs, e.g. the choroid plexus
and the olfactory nerves. He was an industrious dissector, and
he tells us that he had examined more than a hundred bodies.</p>

<p>With Carpi we close our series of Bolognese anatomists. Into
that group we now proceed to fit the writer with whom we are here
specially concerned, Hieronymo Manfredi.</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Hieronymo Manfredi</span></h3>

<p>Hieronymo Manfredi was a member of a family that had
already for more than two centuries provided distinguished
citizens, and especially physicians, to the city of <span class="nowrap">Bologna.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span> He
was born about the year 1430 and was educated at the University
of Bologna. Here in 1455 he was <i>laureatus</i> in Philosophy and
Medicine, and here he became professor of the latter subject in
<span class="nowrap">1463.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span></p>

<p>During the second half of the fifteenth century, a perfect
mania for the study of astrology infected Italy and penetrated
equally into the Court, the Church, and the Academy. The profession
of Medicine was far from immune, and at the University
of Bologna, where a chair of Astrology had long been <span class="nowrap">established,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span>
the study was pursued with ardour and enthusiasm. Here Manfredi
early devoted himself to that will-o’-the-wisp, the pursuit
of which absorbed and sterilized many of the best intellects of
his day. By the year 1469 he was already regarded as an authority
on the vainest of <span class="nowrap">studies,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> and as the years went on he seems to
have devoted himself to it ever more and more. The generally
credulous character of Manfredi’s astrological ideas may be<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
gathered from the page of his <i>Prognosticon ad annum 1479</i> which
we here reproduce (Fig. <a href="#Fig_110">10</a>).</p>

<p>The history of Manfredi’s connexion with the University of
Bologna may be briefly told. He appears for the first time on the
professorial roll in 1462, when we find him giving the ‘extraordinary’
lectures on Philosophy, a subject then regarded as under especial
charge of the physicians. In 1465 he was conducting the ‘ordinary’
course in Philosophy, and at the same time giving occasional
lectures on Medicine. In the following year he was called to the
chair of Theoretical Medicine, and in 1469 he helped the Faculty
out of a difficulty by giving lectures on ‘Astronomia’ in place of
the aged professor Giovanni de Fundis. The latter died in 1474,
and from that date onward Manfredi assumed responsibility for
the course on ‘Astronomia’. Among the colleagues who joined
him were Gabriele de Gerbi, who became lecturer on Logic in 1476,
Filippo Beroaldo, who became lecturer on Rhetoric and Poetry in
1479, and Alessandro Achillini, who became lecturer on Logic in
<span class="nowrap">1484.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the regard for Manfredi’s powers of astrological
prediction that to all the University announcements of his course
of lectures on Astronomy is added ‘cum hoc quod faciat iudicium
et <span class="nowrap">tachuinum’.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span> In spite of his proficiency in the science, however,
he was unable to foretell his own death. Giovanni Pico della
Mirandola writes of him thus derisively:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Hieronymo Manfredi had resided here on that account. His surviving
son, Giovanni, lived hard by in the Via S. Antonio di Padoa.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Manfredi’s printed works suggest great
scientific attainments. All are permeated by the same astrological
obsession. They comprise the following:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The <i>editio princeps</i> of Ptolemy’s <i>Cosmographia</i> and
<i>Tabulae Cosmographiae</i>, the best-​known printed work to which
Manfredi’s name is attached. He was associated in its production
with the famous scholar Filippo Beroaldo, and the finely produced
volume was published at Bologna in 1472 <span class="nowrap">(?),<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span> and dedicated to
the memory of Pope Alexander V (died 1410). It is interesting
as containing the first printed map of England (Fig. <a href="#Fig_109">9</a>). At the
end of the work we read:</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Liber de homine: cuius su[n]t libri duo. Primus liber de
conservatione sanitatis</i><span class="ell">...</span>. [Liber secundus de causis in homine
circa compositione[m] eius], Bologna, 1474. The work is in
Italian, and consists of a number of paragraphs, each beginning
with the word ‘perchè’. There is a servile dedicatory epistle
in Latin addressed to Giovanni Bentivoglio. The first book is
concerned with diet, and occupies two-​thirds of the volume. The
second book answers questions on the subject of physiognomy
and bears resemblance in many passages to the <i>Anatomy</i>. It is
taken in the main from the pseudo-​Aristotelian <i>Problemata</i>. The
book is without pagination or figures. It is well printed, and
illuminated examples are not infrequently encountered.</p>

<p>This work was very popular. In 1478, during the lifetime of
its author, it was audaciously pirated at Naples with the following
<i>incipit</i>: ‘Incomenza el Libro chiamato della uita costumi
natura &amp; om[n]e altra cosa pertine[n]te tanto alla conservatione
della sanita dellomo quanto alle cause et cose humane. Co[m]posto
per <i>Alberto Magno</i> filosofo excellentissimo.’</p>

<p>In 1497, after Manfredi’s death, the work appeared in black-​letter
folio at Bologna, with its author’s original dedication slightly
altered. The text in this edition commences, ‘Perchel sophio nele
cose che noi viuemo: &amp; lo indebito modo del viuere nostro:
induce in noi egritudine’.</p>

<p>In 1507 it appeared at Venice in small black-​letter quarto
as <i>Opera noua intitulata Il perche utilissima ad intendere la
cagione de molte cose</i>. By this title, <i>Il Perchè</i>, the work, which
ran through numerous editions, has usually been known. It
continued to be reprinted as late as 1668.</p>

the same year. The work owes much to Avicenna, but contains<span class="pagenum hide" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
some original clinical observations, and shows a certain independence
of the prevailing spirit of the age by quoting opinions
of contemporary as well as of ancient physicians. The remedies
are similar to those recommended by John of Bourdeaux in his
widely distributed tract on the plague, and are probably derived
ultimately from the <i>Regimen Sanitatis Salerni</i>.</p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">The Manuscript Anatomy of Manfredi</span></h3>

<p>The MS. of Manfredi’s <i>Anatomy</i> is in the Bodleian Library
at Oxford (Canon. Ital. 237, Western 20287). It is a fairly preserved
small quarto parchment, originally of forty-​nine folios, of
which the third and fourth are missing. The writing is in the fine
Italian hand that the printed type of the period was accustomed
to imitate. There are no figures or illuminations, but the titles
are rubricated in burnished gold or in colours.</p>

<p>There is no reference to this work in any account of Manfredi,
and the volume itself appears to be quite unknown. Neither the
man nor his work is mentioned in Medici’s detailed history of
the anatomical school at <span class="nowrap">Bologna<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span> nor in Martinotti’s recent
study on the same <span class="nowrap">topic,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span> nor is any MS. of Manfredi included in
Mazzatinti’s monumental catalogue of the MSS. in the Italian
<span class="nowrap">libraries.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span></p>

<p>Manfredi’s MS. is written in the involved Italian of the day,
with sentences of inordinate length. These general characters of
style are encountered also in his published works. The dedication
is in Latin, of the same unpleasing quality, and is couched
in the usual subservient manner. It is addressed to Giovanni
Bentivoglio, and in it Manfredi relates that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Your illustrious lordship Johannes Bentivolus in this present
year 1490 with your usual humanity condescended on one occasion
to watch the dissection of a corpse<span class="ell">...</span>. It was then that you saw
the wonderful works of Nature in the anatomy <span class="ell">..</span>. and you
parentally urged me, Hieronymo Manfredi, to inscribe to your
most noble name this work on anatomy<span class="ell">...</span>. I therefore extracted
this work as best I might from various works of antiquity and
abbreviated it. I have not followed their order, but I have so
composed it that the work should be pleasing to your lordship.</p>

<p>‘Accept then, O great and powerful lord, this work on the
anatomy of the human body inscribed to your noble name!
Accept it with your customary benevolence and humanity and in
a kindly and gracious spirit, for it will be pleasing to you and
will delight you greatly, for it is a worthy work!’</p></div>

<p>The Giovanni Bentivoglio (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XXXVII">XXXVII</a></span>), with adulation of
whom Manfredi was thus accustomed to plaster his works, was
the second of the name and was the son of Annibale Bentivoglio.
In the year 1462 he became head of the republic of Bologna,
and played there much the same rôle as did Lorenzo de’ Medici
at Florence. He adorned Bologna with numerous <span class="nowrap">buildings,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span>
and acted as patron of the arts and the sciences. The Palazzo
dei Bentivogli still stands as a memorial to him and his family.
A stern and high-​handed tyrant, he held his position until 1506,
when he was expelled and the city reverted to the papacy. He
died two years later.</p>

<p>It is remarkable to find a man of Bentivoglio’s eminence and
position taking an interest in the practical study of anatomy.
Other Italian rulers, Lorenzo de’ Medici among them, encouraged
and legalized the practice of dissection, but probably Bentivoglio
is the only one recorded as having patronized an ‘anatomy’ in
person. The interest taken in the subject by the heads of states
must have been of great value to the artists whose patrons they
were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span></p>

<p>The MS. is a unique copy, and was doubtless written for
presentation to Bentivoglio. That it was never printed is perhaps
due to the fact that Manfredi died within a comparatively short
time of its composition. It represents the most satisfactory post-​mediaeval
account of the human frame until the appearance of
the work of Berengario da Carpi in 1521. It is more complete
than the work of William of Saliceto or of Mondino or the anatomy
erroneously attributed to Richardus Anglicus; it is more natural
than the book of Gabriele de Gerbi, and is far superior to the
crude contemporary sketches of Hundt, Peyligk, and Achillini,
while it wastes less space than Guy de Chauliac on teleology,
though it has none of the charm of the work of that great surgeon.
In one respect at least, viz. the spirit in which it is written, Manfredi’s
<i>Anatomy</i> is original and probably unique for its age. There
is no reason to doubt the assurance of the dedication that it was
composed for the edification of the tyrant of Bologna, and for the
simple purpose of setting forth the wonderful structure of man’s
body without thought of any medical application.</p>

<p>The sources of the MS. are obvious. It is in the main a rearranged
and on the whole improved Mondino, but amplified by
reference to translations from Galen, Rhazes, Haly Abbas, and
Avicenna. Guy de Chauliac has perhaps also been used. The
work gives a general impression of being the product of a practical
dissector, and it provides us with a good example of early Renaissance
anatomy as taught in the Italian schools before the reforms
of Vesalius. It is perhaps the first complete treatise on its subject
written originally in the <span class="nowrap">vernacular.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span> It exhibits, however, no
other original features nor any considerable departures from its
sources, and it may be taken to represent, with but little modification,
the tradition of Mondino as developed at his own University
of Bologna at the end of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Manfredi’s work, however, if not original is at least eclectic,
and the variety of its sources indicates a dawning consciousness
of the unwisdom of trusting to the infallibility of any one writer.
The work is thus in a sense intermediate between the early printed
versions of Mondino, such as that of 1478, and the edition<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
published in 1528 by Berengario da Carpi with its frank commentary
of the master. All represent stages towards the freedom
of the later Renaissance investigators.</p>

<p>We reproduce the text in full, and the passages on the head,
on the eye, and on the heart, are rendered into English. All are
similar to the accounts of Mondino. We are able to illustrate
them by figures from contemporary works, and thus to give an
idea of the limits of the anatomical knowledge of the day.</p>


<h3>V. <span class="smcap">Translation of Selected Passages from the Anatomy,
with Commentary</span></h3>

<h4>(<i>a</i>) THE HEAD</h4>

<p class="tac">Tractate i, Chapter 2</p>

<p>(folio 5 verso) There are ten layers of the head.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> is the <i>hair</i> made by nature for the better protection
of the head from external things, and also for beauty.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> part is the <i>skin</i>, which has here to be very thick,
so that the hair may be firmly embedded, having its roots thick
and long; and also to be a better shield and covering for the
bone and brain, since there is no muscular part here.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> part is the <i>flesh</i>, developed only on the face, the
temples, and about the jaws, not on the other parts.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth</i> part is an external membrane called <i>almochatim</i>
[Arabian term for cranial periosteum] which, when the skin is
raised, appears to be continuous and covers the whole cranium.
And nature made this membrane firstly so that the skin which
is soft should not come into contact with the hard bone, secondly
that the bone of the head should have sensation through it, and
thirdly that the internal membrane of the head, called <i>dura mater</i>,
should, by means of this membrane, be attached to the bone
of the cranium by certain nerves and ligaments. These, issuing
through the commissures of the bones, have thus their origin in
the aforesaid internal membrane, while on emerging through the
bone, they weave themselves into or rather compose the external
membrane called <i>almochatim</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>fifth</i> part is the <i>skull</i>. This is a bone like a cap, inside
the cavity of which is located the brain. In the skull are four
bones sutured together. Nature made the skull not of one but
of many pieces, firstly, so that if harm should fall on one part it<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
might not spread to the others; secondly, so that by their joints
or rather sutures [Italian <i>cusiture</i>=sewings], the humours of the
brain might be the better exhaled; and thirdly, so that when there
is need of applying medicines, these might the better penetrate
to the parts within.</p>

<p>Hence it is that four pieces of bone are sutured and joined
together by nature in a denticulate fashion, so that they might
be the firmer and stronger. Nor are they bound with ligaments
as are the joints, for these would not have been so strong, and
furthermore the bones of the head do not need to move.</p>

<p>These sutures are five in number, three being true and two
false. The true sutures are those which pass right through the
bone, while the false do not. Of the true sutures one is in the
anterior part and is called <i>coronal</i>; it is made like the letter C,
and stretches from right to left of the head, the two wings of the
C being directed towards the forehead. The second true suture
extends along the length of the head, beginning from the coronal
and reaching the back part of the head. It is like a shaft or rather
arrow that goes backwards from the brow, wherefore it is called
<i>sagittal</i> <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;(.</span> The third true suture is in the posterior part
and is called laudal, for it is made like a Λ, the letter called by
the Greeks <i>lauda</i>. The sagittal suture extends from the coronal
to the lauda <span class="nowrap">〉&mdash;&mdash;(.</span></p>

<p>The false sutures are two, one on each side. They are called
<i>cortical</i> because they do not penetrate.</p>

<p>Now if we consider these five sutures we shall see that there
are four bones articulated together. One is the forehead bone
[frontal] which begins at the coronal and ends below at another
suture, which itself begins as a branch of the coronal suture and
proceeds by way of the eyebrow to the corresponding branch [of
the other side] Ɑ.</p>

<p>A second bone is behind and terminates at the laudal suture.
There are two other bones which form the temples. These terminate
at the false sutures which themselves begin at the laudal
and end at the coronal suture.</p>

<p>The <i>sixth</i> part [of the head] consists of two membranes. One
of these is called <i>dura mater</i>, and lies in contact with the cranium.
The other is called <i>pia mater</i> and is in contact with and covers
the brain. And nature contrived it thus, having great solicitude
for this latter member, that while close to the bone, it should<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
yet not be touched by it. Wherefore, taking due precautions,
she made the one [membrane] harder than the other. Furthermore
she made two membranes, so that if harm befell one of
them, it might not be communicated to the underlying brain.</p>

<p>In the <i>pia mater</i> are woven certain veins by which the brain
is nourished. [The brain is] everywhere covered by it except
on the posterior part; because this part being dry, it has no
need of this membrane, as have the anterior and middle parts.
The two membranes in many places penetrate the substance of
the brain, dividing it into a right and a left, a front and a back
section. By this division, divers cells or rather small chambers
are made therein, in which the soul (<i>anima</i>) performs its divers
operations, for which reason it is necessary that these parts should
be of different structure.</p>

<p>When the two membranes are raised, the <i>seventh</i> part of the
head, namely the brain itself, appears. The brain is wrought by
nature so that the <i>vital spirit</i> from the torrid heart should be
tempered by its cold, for here it is converted into <i>animal spirit</i>,
which is the beginning of the perceptive (<i>cognoscitiue</i>) and motive
processes.</p>

<p>The brain is of a substance like marrow, white, soft, and
viscous, and from it the nerves arise. The anterior part is moister,
softer, and less cold than the posterior because the senses [<i>sentimenti</i>
=&nbsp;senses + mental processes], which are themselves moist and
soft, have here their origin. In the posterior part the motor
nerves arise, and it is therefore drier and firmer.</p>

<p>The brain is divided into three parts or ventricles. The first
ventricle or anterior part is itself divided into two, right and
left, and is moreover larger than any of the other ventricles, for
in this first ventricle nature has placed the two faculties subservient
to perception (<i>al cognoscere</i>). One of these is called
<i>common sensation</i> (<i>senso comune</i>); in it the external senses terminate
as at a centre and deliver the <i>images</i> or rather <i>species</i> of
sensible things, so that this faculty may perceive and distinguish
between one sensible thing and another, and also comprehend the
operations of particular senses; which two things none of these
[senses of themselves can do]. The other faculty of the first
ventricle is called <i>fantasia</i> and by some <i>imagination</i>; it retains
and preserves the <i>species</i> of sensible things in the absence of the
material objects themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span></p>

<p>When thou examinest the first ventricle thou wilt see three
things before thou comest to the second ventricle.</p>

<p>[<i>a</i>] The first is itself double, and is formed of the very substance
of the brain, so that it forms the base of the anterior ventricle
both right and left [=&nbsp;corpora striata].</p>

<p>[<i>b</i>] To the side of this is another thing like a subterranean
worm, red as blood, yet tethered by certain ligaments and nervelets
[=&nbsp;choroid plexus and taenia semicircularis]. And this worm when
it lengthens itself closes these passages, and thus blocks the path
between the first ventricle and the second. Nature has wrought
it thus, so that when a man wills he may cease from cogitation
and thought; and similarly when, on the other hand, he would
think and contemplate, this worm contracts itself again and
opens these passages and thus frees the way between one ventricle
and another.</p>

<p>[<i>c</i>] The third structure is a little lower and is a <i>lacuna</i> or
rounded concavity [=&nbsp;infundibulum]. In the middle of this is
a hole which passes down towards the palate, and this lacuna
provides also a direct passage which descends from the middle
ventricle to its <i>colature</i> [=&nbsp;sieve-​like structure, i.e. certain parts
of the sphenoid bone]. And this lacuna has around it certain
large round eminences which support the veins and arteries that
ascend to the ventricle. This passage is wide above and narrow
below, and by it the first and second ventricles purge themselves
of their superfluities, but the anterior part [of the first ventricle]
purges itself more by the colature of the nose [=&nbsp;cribriform plate].
Thus nature has made two passages to cleanse the superfluities
of the brain.</p>

<p>When thou hast seen these three structures there will appear
the second or middle ventricle which is as a passage and transit
from the anterior to the posterior ventricle. Here are two faculties.
One, the <i>estimative</i>, deduces [Italian <i>elicere</i>] the insensible from
the sensible. The other, called the <i>cognitive</i>, comprehends both
things sensible and things insensible, synthesizing and analysing
them (<i>componendo e dividendo</i>). These [two] faculties in the middle
ventricle minister to the intellect. Now all the other faculties
described, and even the power of memory, are found in brute
animals, but this [intellectual power] is encountered in man alone.</p>

<p>Now will appear the third ventricle in the posterior part;
and it is hard, for it gives rise to the greater part of the motive<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
nerves which are of a strong and firm nature. This ventricle is
pyramidal in shape, and culminates in an apex directed upwards
where images of visible things (<i>spetie</i>) are conserved, for these
are better stored in a strait than in an ample space; but the part
below is wide to receive these images, which are better received in
an ample than in a strait place. This ventricle has two functions:
it gives rise to the spinal cord [<i>nucha</i>, an Arabian term] and
motor nerves; and it is also the storehouse of the <i>memorative</i>
faculties.</p>

<p>From what [has been said] it will be apparent that when the
back of the head is injured, the memory immediately suffers;
when the middle part is injured, the estimative and cognitive
faculties suffer; and when the anterior part is injured, the
faculties of common sensation and of imagination (<i>fantasia</i>) suffer.
And thus it is that the doctors have become aware of the location
of these powers.</p>

<p>This being disposed of, thou wilt next raise the brain carefully
so as not to break the nerves. Commencing now with the part
in front, there will first appear two small fleshy protuberances
like two nipples, of like substance to the brain in which they
originate, and covered by a thin membrane, the pia mater. These
are the olfactory organs, wherein is the sense of smell.</p>

<p>From the brain arise seven pairs of nerves. Proceed therefore
farther with the anterior part, and thou wilt see the first
pair of these nerves, which are large, and called the <i>nervi optici</i>.
These have their origin in the front ventricle of the brain and
proceed towards the eyes. But before they pass through the
pia mater, they join together, and at their place of union there
is a perforated spot. Galen maintains that these nerves only join
or rather unite, but do not intersect, so that the nerve that comes
from the right after union returns again towards the right, and
similarly with the nerve coming from the left, which after the
union returns towards the left <span class="nowrap">eye.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span> But Rhazes maintains the
<span class="nowrap">contrary,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span> although the opinion of Galen is the more common.
These nerves are subservient to sight, and they are united so
that the images of the things received by the two eyes and
conveyed by the two nerves should return in unity; so that one
thing should not appear as two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span></p>

<p>After these two nerves, raise the brain towards its middle
and thou wilt see another pair of nerves, thin and firm, which
also go to the eyes, to give them voluntary movement, controlling
certain muscles.</p>

<p>Farther on thou wilt see the third pair of nerves, one part of
which goes to the face to give it sensation and voluntary movement,
while another part goes to give taste to the tongue. Yet
a third part of these nerves mingles with the <span class="nowrap">fourth<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span> pair of nerves,
and together they descend to give sensation to the diaphragm,
stomach, and other viscera. A certain part also of the fourth<a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>
pair of nerves goes to give sensation to the palate.</p>

<p>Then there is the fifth pair of nerves [which] go to the <i>petrous</i>
bone around the ear; and of these nerves there are framed in
the ear-holes certain membranes, which are the organs of hearing.</p>

<p>Next there is the sixth pair of nerves, which divides into three
parts. One part goes to the muscles of the throat, the second
to the muscles of the shoulders, and the third and largest descends
to the epiglottis and to the diaphragm, and spreads into the
chest, the heart, and the lungs, accompanying the nerves of the
third pair. From the nerves of this sixth pair which go to
the epiglottis arise the nerves of the voice, called <i>reversive</i>.</p>

<p>The seventh pair of nerves arise at the back of the brain and
give voluntary movement to the tongue.</p>

<p>Of these seven pairs of nerves, the first two pairs originate
in the anterior part of the brain, the third pair originates between
the anterior and posterior parts, while the remaining four pairs
originate in the posterior part.</p>

<p>Proceeding still farther, the brain may be completely raised,
and the eighth part of the head will appear, that is, the two membranes
situated below the brain. When these in turn are raised
there will appear the ninth part, which is a certain net called
<i>rethe mirabile</i>, because it is composed of exceedingly strong and
marvellous texture, augmented by certain very fine arteries
which are branches of arteries that ascend from the heart, and
are called the <i>apoplectic arteries</i>. In these arteries of this net is
contained the vital spirit, sent from the heart to be changed to
animal spirit. That the spirit may be the better modified and
distributed, nature made these arteries very fine, and separated<span class="pagenum hide" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
them into very small branches so that the spirit should be minutely
divided. Nature placed the rethe mirabile under the brain because
it was necessary to guard its site carefully, and also that the
moist vapours of the brain which fall upon the net, obstructing
it, should induce natural sleep.</p>

<p>After all these things thou wilt see the basal bone which is
the tenth and last part of the head, and called <i>basilar</i>, because
it is the base and foundation of the whole head; and it was
made hard so that the superfluities which descend to it should
not putrefy it. This bone can be seen to be formed of many
other bones articulated together. It is divisible into the petrous
bones and the bones of the nose and eyes and two other lateral
bones which can only be seen by means of disarticulation. [Folio
10 verso, line 22.]</p>

<p>The ten parts or layers of the head are a commonplace of the
anatomy of the period, taken from Avicenna. We may illustrate
the division by the crude contemporary diagram of Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_111">11</a>, which

<p>Manfredi’s account of the brain itself is amplified from Mondino.
The division of this organ into three ventricles, each
associated with a corresponding division of the mental functions,
was very familiar to medical writers of the fifteenth century.
The idea is found among Western writers as early as St. Augustine
(354–430), and is encountered in the writings of Roger Bacon
(1214–94). It had long been popularized in mediaeval psychology
by the writings of Albertus Magnus (1206–80). The anatomical
distinction is found in Haly Abbas, Avicenna, and Rhazes, and
in some of the best MSS. of the latter writer a rough diagram of
the ventricles is <span class="nowrap">given.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span> These writers are all clearly indebted to

who in turn derived his inspiration from Nemesius (fourth

<p>The brain was<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
regarded by mediaeval and early Renaissance anatomists as
having two channels of discharge through which the <i>phlegm</i>,
the especial product of this organ, could be evacuated when in
excess. One of these channels communicated with the anterior
ventricle of the brain and poured its secretion into the nose. It
may be identified with the <i>anterior colature</i> or cribriform plate.
The second, the <i>lacuna</i>, led down from the second ventricle and
poured its secretion into the pharynx. It may be identified with
the infundibulum, pituitary body, and ‘cella turcica’. The term
‘pituitary’ which we still use is derived from its supposed association
with the ‘pituita’ or phlegm. At an early date this process
was connected with the four humours (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_114">14</a>). The rest of the
description of the brain can be easily followed. The comparison
of the choroid plexus to a worm is very common. The suggestion
originated with Galen and was developed by the Arabians.</p>

<p>The nomenclature of the cranial nerves adopted by Manfredi

whose classification is summarized <span class="nowrap">above.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span> Manfredi’s description

<p>The ‘rete mirabile’ is an interesting survival of Galenic
anatomy. This structure is hardly present in man, but is developed
in the lower animals, and especially in calves, upon whose bodies
Galen worked. The father of physiology regarded the ‘rete
mirabile’ as the place where the psychic pneuma was <span class="nowrap">elaborated.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span>
Galen’s findings in the lower animals were assiduously transferred
to the human body, to which his descriptions are much less
applicable, while his views on the pneuma lasted in more or less
misunderstood form well into the seventeenth century.</p>


<h4>(<i>b</i>) THE EYE</h4>

<p class="tac">Tractate i, Chapter 3</p>

<p>(folio 11 recto) The socket of the eye is not over-depressed, for
it has to receive the images (<i>spetie</i>) of visible things. Nor does
it project greatly, lest it should be liable to injury from exterior
violence. For the eyes of man being very soft and susceptible,
nature provided eyebrows as a shield above, and eyelids as protectors
in front, and made moreover the projections of the maxillae
and the nose, so that the eyes should be guarded on every side.
So great was the solicitude of nature for these members.</p>

<p>Seven are the tunics of the eye and three its humours. Three
front coatings join with three coatings at the back like six shields,
the edges of every pair joining each to each, the outer being
larger and containing the others. The seventh tunic is largest of
all, and encloses the whole eye, and therefore it is called <i>conjunctiva</i>
because it joins and surrounds the whole eye except the
place where the pupil is, and that small part [is covered] by the<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
cornea. Now this first tunic where it covers the outside part is
seen to be white.</p>

<p>The second tunic in its front part is called <i>cornea</i> because it
resembles horn in its substance and colour; and this covering is
transparent, so that the images of visible things may penetrate
through it. And it is also solid and large and composed of four
membranes, so that being near external things it should not
receive hurt. With this [corneal tunic] is united posteriorly
another tunic [the third] called <i>sclerotic</i>, i.e. hard. These two
coverings have their origin in the membrane about the brain,
that is in the dura mater, just as the first tunic arises from the
membrane over the skull, called <i>almochatim</i>.</p>

<p>The fourth tunic as to its front part is called <i>uvea</i> [because] it is
like a seed of a black grape, and in its midst is a hole called the
pupil. Nature made this tunic opaque so that the visual spirit
should be conserved and not dissipated by the light outside.
Moreover nature made the opening in the tunic that the image
might penetrate freely; while it is narrow, so that the visual
spirit should be concentrated. Thus when the said pupil, or
rather hole, dilates more than usual, either naturally or accidentally,
the sight becomes imperfect. [The uveal tunic] joins posteriorly
the fifth tunic, called <i>secundina</i> because it is made like
the after-birth, i.e. the membrane in which the child is enveloped
in its mother’s womb, and it arises from the pia mater.</p>

<p>The sixth coating in front is called <i>arachnoid</i> because it is
formed after the manner of a spider’s web, and posteriorly it joins
the seventh coating, called <i>retina</i>, because it is made like a net.</p>

<p>Between the uvea and the arachnoid anteriorly there is a
humour called <i>albugineus</i>, like the white of an egg, to moisten
the eye and to preserve the convexity of the cornea. In a dead
man this humour dries up, and the cornea falls and is flattened,
and then the vulgar say that there appears a curtain before the
eyes which is an infallible sign of death. Also this humour holds
the pupil open; therefore when it dries up the pupil contracts.</p>

<p>Between the two last tunics, i.e. the arachnoid and the retina,
which have their origin from the optic nerve, there are two humours.
These are the <i>vitreous</i> humour, so called from its likeness to
liquified glass, and the <i>crystalline</i> humour, from its likeness to
a crystal. This is also called the <i>grandid</i>, because it is like
a hailstone; and it is somewhat hard and round, but flattened<span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
anteriorly where it receives the images of visible things, and
posteriorly pyramidal shape and pointed. And here is completed
the act of seeing. In the posterior part it is surrounded by the
vitreous humours by which it is nourished. The crystalline
humour is convex anteriorly and the vitreous posteriorly. And
the optic nerves come to the eyes and convey the images seen
by the eyes to [the seat of] common sensation and to the other
internal faculties. [Folio 12 verso, line 7.]</p>

<p>A great deal of attention was paid by the Arabians to the

description are to be found in Rhazes, Hunain ben Ishak,<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
and Haly Abbas. The tradition presented by these writers
passed early into Western science, and is reproduced, for example,
in the works of Constantine Africanus and in the well-​known
anatomy to which the name of Richardus Anglicus (Richard of
Wendover) has become <span class="nowrap">attached<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span> (cp. Fig. 19). Avicenna’s
description of the eye is somewhat different, and gave rise to the
tradition reproduced in the works of John of Peckham and of Roger
Bacon (Plate <a href="#XXXVIIIa"><span class="lowercase smcap">XXXVIII</span> <i>a</i></a>), and it influenced
the views of Leonardo and even
perhaps of Vesalius (Fig. 20). The views
on the anatomy of the eye expressed by
Rhazes, Hunain ben Ishak, and Haly
Abbas were, on the whole, more widely
accepted than those of Avicenna.</p>

<p>The treatment of the eye was always
felt to be hardly within the range of
the ordinary practitioner of surgery, and
its structure, as we learn from Guy de
<span class="nowrap">Chauliac,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span> was not usually treated in the
general course of anatomy. The custom
was rather to refer the student to
special works such as those of Jesu Aly
or of Alcoatim.</p>

<p>Manfredi’s description of the anatomy
of the eye is that generally
accepted at the end of the fifteenth and
the beginning of the sixteenth centuries,
and is unusually clear for its date. It
represents a considerable advance on
such writers as Henri de Mondeville
<span class="nowrap">(1260–1320)<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> or the pseudo Richardus

that of Vesalius (1543, Fig.&nbsp;20), whose description of the eye is less
free from traditional bias than are most parts of his epoch-​making
work.</p>

<p>In reading any early description of the eye, it is to be remembered
that until the nineteenth century the ‘emanation theory’
prevailed. Light was regarded as of the nature of a stream of
particles emitted from the object seen, and the act of vision was
considered as a collision of this emanation with an emission of
something from the eye itself, called in mediaeval writings the
‘visual spirit’.</p>


<h4>(<i>c</i>) THE HEART</h4>

<p class="tac">Tractate ii, Chapter 3</p>

<p>(folio 19 verso) Then you will see in the midst of the lung the
heart, covered by its membranes. [It is thus situated] that the air
attracted by this lung should cool it, and that thus the heat and
spirit of the heart be tempered. This member is the most important
of the four [principal members], because it is the first to live and the
last to die. It is of medium size compared with the other members
of man, but compared with the hearts of other animals it is very
large, because man, in a quantitative and not an intensive sense,
has more natural heat than other animals. It is pyramidal, that
is in the form of a flame; because it is of excellent warmth,<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
therefore it is necessary that it should be of a shape resembling
a flame. Its figure is also called ‘pine-​shaped’, because it is
wide below and narrow above, being thus formed that distinction
could better be made between its cavities or ventricles; moreover,
had it been made of a shape all uniform as is the lower part, it
would be too heavy and ponderous.</p>

<p>This member is situated in the middle of the entire body,
measured in every direction; that is, in the middle between the
upper and lower parts: in the middle also between front and back
and right and left, like a king standing in the midst of his kingdom,
and this was done that it might give the strength of life equally
to all the members; and although the heart as regards its foundation
and base be in the middle, yet its point declines to the left
below the left breast, so that it warms the left side as the liver
warms the right.</p>

<p>This member is sustained and strengthened by a certain
cartilaginous bone. For since it is continually moving, it needs
some point of purchase to support it in its movements. Moreover,
it has a certain fatty layer on the outside which prevents the
heart from drying and keeps it moist: and there are certain veins
and arteries dispersed through its substance: and it is formed
also of a kind of hard flesh so that it may sustain many and
forceful movements; also it is formed of longitudinal, latitudinal,
and transverse fibres, so that it may have the power to attract,
retain, and expel.</p>

<p>This member has three ventricles or chambers, like the brain.
One ventricle is on the right side, the second on the left, and the
third in between. The right ventricle towards the liver has two
orifices. One is towards the liver and is very large. Into this
there enters a vein called <i>vena chilis</i>, which arises in the convexity
of the liver and brings the blood from the liver to the
heart. In that right ventricle the blood is purified, and then
sent by the heart to all the other members.</p>

<p>Now since the heart attracts by this orifice of the <i>vena chilis</i>
more than it expels, therefore nature ordains that in the moment
of contraction when the blood is expelled this orifice closes, and
when the heart dilates it opens.</p>

<p>Moreover there are three little valves (<i>hostiolitti</i>) or doors
opening from without inward, and these valves are not very
depressed; so that by this same orifice only part of the purified<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
blood is expelled to the other members, because part goes to the
lungs and the remainder forms the vital spirit; therefore nature
ordains that these valves do not entirely close. From the <i>vena
chilis</i>, before it enters the cavity of the heart, there arises another
vein, which surrounds the root of the heart; and from it are
given off branches which disperse themselves through the substance
of the heart, and from the blood of that vein the heart
nourishes itself.</p>

<p>The right ventricle towards the lung has another orifice into
which opens the <i>arterial vein</i>, bringing the blood from the heart
to nourish the lung: in this orifice also are three valves (<i>hostioli</i>)
opening from within outward and closing from without inward,
in the opposite way to the valves of the other orifice; and
this is so that they should entirely close. Hence by this orifice
the heart during the period of contraction can expel, and yet
during the period of its dilatation cannot attract anything through
it as was done in the first orifice.</p>

<p>The left ventricle of the heart has its sides denser and thicker
than the sides or walls of the right ventricle; and this for three
reasons: Firstly, because in the right ventricle is contained the
blood, which is heavy, while in the left ventricle there is spirit,
which is very light; therefore in order that the heart should not
be heavier and more ponderous on one side than on the other,
it was necessary to compensate in this manner, that is, that the
left ventricle should be thicker in its walls than the right. In the
second place, the spirit being more subtil and more volatile
(<i>resolubile</i>) than blood, it needs a stronger habitation and better
supports. Thirdly, the left ventricle is much warmer than the
right, because in it is generated the spirit from the blood, by
a great heat which makes that blood more subtil; and heat is
better preserved in a substance that is dense and thick.</p>

<p>In the cavity of this ventricle near its root are two orifices:
one is the orifice of an artery called <i>artharia adorti</i> [=&nbsp;aorta],
because it has immediate origin in the heart and because it is the
source of all the others: by this artery the heart sends the generated
spirit to all the members; and the very subtil blood is
mixed with the spirit when the heart contracts. For which
reason there are at the entrance of this orifice three valves, which
close entirely from the outside inwards; and they open from
the inside outwards, and this orifice is very deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span></p>

<p>The other orifice is that of the <i>venal artery</i> which conveys
the air from the lung to cool the heart and transports warm
vapours from the heart to the lung as has been said above; and
in this orifice are two valves which do not entirely close: and
they are well raised so that they can better apply themselves to
the sides [edges] of the heart when it sends out the spirit: these
are marvellous works of nature, as is also the central ventricle of
the heart, for this ventricle has not one cavity but many; these
are small but wide, and more numerous on the right than on the
left; and nature contrived thus, so that the blood which goes
from the right ventricle to the left to be converted continually
into spirit becomes thin in these cavities.</p>

<p>And by this thou canst see that four things have birth in the
heart. The first is the artery called <i>adorti</i>, the second is the
<i>vena chilis</i>, the third is the <i>arterial vein</i>, and the fourth the <i>venal
artery</i>.</p>

<p>Also thou wilt see in the heart certain membranous parts like
<i>auricles</i>, or rather like small ears, able to dilate or contract: these
are contrived by nature in order that when overmuch blood or
spirit is generated the heart can dilate so as to contain it; and
also that the heart may contract when there is no such abundance.</p>

<p>And it is here that Galen asks, Why did not nature make the
heart so large that it could contain every increase of blood or
spirit without the addition of these membranes? Galen replies
that this was first because the heart would have been too large
and therefore too heavy; secondly, because as it is not always
generating a great quantity of blood and spirit, if the heart had
been too large, its cavity would usually have been empty: but
these auricles dilate with the accumulation of blood or spirit, and
contract with its decrease.</p>

<p>The heart is surrounded by a firm and nervous membrane,
like a little house in which it is placed as in a tabernacle to defend
it from accidents. This capsule is very dilated, that the heart in
its dilations and movement may not be impeded thereby, and
therefore nature made this capsule so that it should contain a certain
dewy moisture with which the heart is bathed and moistened
so that in its continual movement it should not become dry. For
when this water be dried up, then the heart itself is desiccated,
and emaciates and dries up all the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The description of the heart follows Mondino closely. Occasionally
a phrase or two is reminiscent of Mondeville. The trite
conception of the heart as a king in its necessarily central position
was very frequently repeated by writers in the Middle Ages. To
Harvey, who had a certain mediaeval element in his mentality,
it seems to have appealed, and he used it in his <i>Prelectiones
Anatomiae</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span> and chose it to introduce his great work on the circulation
of the <span class="nowrap">blood.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span> The heart was similarly described as ‘flame-​shaped’,
because it was regarded as the source of animal heat.
The idea that it is the first to live and the last to die comes from
<span class="nowrap">Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span> The <i>bone</i> in the heart also comes from <span class="nowrap">Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span> The
idea was quite familiar to mediaeval anatomists, who frequently endeavoured
to identify the <i>bone</i> with the firm tissue around the orifices
of the aorta and pulmonary artery. The reader may be reminded
that a true ‘os cordis’ is in fact to be found in some mammalia.</p>

<p>Mondino, followed by Manfredi, describes the action of the
heart and blood-​vessels mainly according to the views of Galen,
but without any very clear or connected statement. The ‘third
ventricle’ especially has its origin in a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>This mythical structure is an attempt to combine the views
of Aristotle and of Galen. Aristotle, who probably never dissected
a human body, derived his anatomical conceptions largely from
cold-​blooded animals, in some of which the heart is provided
with three cavities. He considered that the heart had three
chambers, the largest being on the right, the smallest on the left,
and one of intermediate size between the two. As far as they can
be identified, the largest was the right ventricle plus the right
auricle, the smallest or left chamber was the left auricle, while
the intermediate cavity appears to have been the left <span class="nowrap">ventricle.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span></p>

<br />
From the Roncioni MS. (Pisa 99)
after Sudhoff.</p>
</div>

<p>Galen’s description differed altogether from that of Aristotle.
He tells us expressly and somewhat contemptuously that ‘it is
no marvel if Aristotle erred in many anatomical matters, a man
who thought forsooth that the heart in the larger animals had three
<span class="nowrap">chambers’.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> Galen always describes the heart as having but two
chambers, the right and left ventricles, a wholly subordinate part
being assigned to the auricles. These latter were regarded as safety-​valves,
expanding to hold superfluous blood when the chambers of
the heart to which they correspond become overfilled.</p>

<p>No third ventricle is described by Rhazes or Haly <span class="nowrap">Abbas,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span>
but Avicenna, in his <i>Canon</i>, makes an effort to combine the
views of Aristotle and Galen. Speaking
of the anatomy of the heart (lib. iii,
fen. xi, chap.&nbsp;1) he describes the ventricular
portion as follows: ‘In the heart
are three cavities, two large, and a third
as it were central in position. So that
the heart has [<i>a</i>] a receptacle [the right
ventricle] for the nutriment with which
it nourishes itself&mdash;this nutriment is
thick and firm like the substance of the
heart; [<i>b</i>] a place where the pneuma is
formed [the left ventricle], being engendered
of the subtil blood; and [<i>c</i>], thirdly, a canal between the <span class="nowrap">two.’<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span>
A somewhat similar account is given in Constantine’s translation
of <span class="nowrap">Isaac.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span> The idea soon crept into European medicine, for in a
Pisan MS. dating from the first half of the thirteenth <span class="nowrap">century<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span>
a crude figure of a three-​chambered heart is to be found (Fig. 21).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span></p>

<p>The first translator of the <i>Canon of Avicenna</i>, Gerard of Cremona,
whose work appeared towards the end of the twelfth century,
improved on his original. ‘In it [the heart] are three ventricles;
two are large, and the third as it were between, which Galen
called the fovea or non-​ventricular meatus, so that there may be
a receptaculum for the thick and strong nourishment, like to the
substance of the heart, with which it is nourished, and also a storehouse
for the pneuma (spiritus) generated in it from the subtil
blood. And between the two are channels or <span class="nowrap">meatuses.’<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span> Henri<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
de Mondeville (died about 1320), by going direct to Galen, avoided
some of the errors of Avicenna, with whom, however, he still
describes three <span class="nowrap">ventricles.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> Mondino does little but copy the
Arabian, whom Manfredi also follows.</p>

<p>We may terminate our description of the mythical third
ventricle by quoting from Bartholomew the Englishman. His
encyclopaedia written about 1260 was translated into English
in 1397, and printed by Thomas <span class="nowrap">Berthelet<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span> in the 27th year of
the reign of Henry VIII (1535), when Bartholomew’s work was
still extremely popular. Berthelet’s rendering runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘And the hert hath ij holownesses, one in the left syde, that
cometh sharpe: and one in the ryght side, that is within: And
these two holownesses ben called the wombes of the hart. And
betwene these two wombes is one hole, that some men call a veyne,
other an holowe way. And this hole is brode afore the ryghte
syde, and streyte afore the left syde. And that is nedefulle to make
the bloode subtyll, that commeth from the ryght wombe to the
lefte, and so the spirite of lyfe may be bredde the easelyer in the
lefte wombe.’</p></div>

<p>In order to understand why all these authors invoked the
existence of the third ventricle, regarded by some of them as
a passage between the other two, we must turn to the physiological
beliefs of the age. It must be recalled that before the
demonstration of the circulatory movement of the blood a<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>
certain amount of communication was believed to exist between
right and left ventricles. The complicated nature of the
ventricular cavities and the intricacy of the columnae carneae
promoted the idea of the presence of minute passages in the
interventricular septum. Even so astute an observer as Leonardo
da Vinci considered that ‘the ventricles are separated by a <i>porous</i>
wall, through which the blood of the right ventricle penetrates
into the left ventricle, and when the right ventricle shuts, the
left opens and draws in the blood which the right one gives forth’
(Plate <a href="#XXXVIIIb"><span class="lowercase smcap">XXXVIII</span> <i>b</i></a>)<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span></p>

menbris Anathomia</i>, Strassburg, 1513. The diagram shows the two lateral ventricles and the
‘central’ ventricle. By a printer’s error the letters <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> are transposed. The <i>arteria
adorti</i> is the aorta, the <i>arteria venalis</i> the pulmonary vein, the <i>vena chilis</i> the vena cava, and the
<i>vena arterialis</i> the pulmonary artery. The auricles are ignored, as is frequently the case
in works of the period, and the pulmonary veins are represented as opening directly into
the ventricles.</p>
</div>

<p>Although the third ventricle is described in all the twenty-​five
editions of Mondino, many of which are illustrated, they present
no drawing of it except the wretched little diagram of J.&nbsp;A.
Muelich (Johannes Adelphus) in 1513, which we here reproduce
(Fig. 22). The confusion, however, to which the idea of a third
ventricle gave rise influenced anatomy almost as late as the
seventeenth century, and is illustrated in the anatomical figures
of a late edition of Hans von Gersdorff <span class="nowrap">(1556),<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span> where the trachea
is actually shown opening into the left ventricle (Fig. 23). It was
Vesalius who took the first great step towards the discovery of
the circulation of the blood, by firmly maintaining that the interventricular

mouere non era suspitione de rompersi como ne le artarie che era
neccessario a mouerse per refrigerare el core atrahendo laiere frigido &amp; expellendo
fuora li fumi caldi da esso.</p>

<p>Li panniculi sono composti e texuti de fili neruosi sutilissimi che non se
posseno uedere e sono questi paniculi spissi e sutili e sono de molte manerie:
Alcuni forno facti a continere o coprire a Alcuni membri e custodirli ne la
sua figura e substantia como sono li paniculi che copreno el cerebro e molti
altri di li quali poi diremo: Alcuni altri panniculi sono facti a suspendere
uno membro a laltro como li rognoni sono aligati a laschina mediante uno
certo paniculo: Alcuni altri paniculi sono facti acio che alcuni membri che
non hano sentimento recceuano qualche sentimento per el panniculo: nel
quale sono inuolti como sono el pulmone el figato la milza &amp; i rognoni li
quali sono priuati de sentimento impero la natura aciascuno di loro li fece
uno panniculo doue fusseuo inuolti per la casone dicta.</p>

<p>Da poi tuti questi membra hauendo la natura ordito el corpo de lhomo
de [folio 4 recto] li predicti bisogno reimpire le uacuita e reimpille de carne:
Fece aduncha la natura la carne per reimpire le uacuita che rimangono da
lorditura de nerui uene &amp; altri membri dicti.</p>

<p>Praeterea e da sapere che la natura ha dato aciascuno di li predicti
membri quatro uirtu. Una e uirtu atratiua per laquale ha ad atrahere el
nutrimento suo a se del quale el membro se ha a nutricare: La seconda
uirtu e digegtiua per laquale el nutrimento atrato se digerisse &amp; conuertese ne
la sustantia del membro: La terza uirtu si e retentiua per laquale el nutrimento
atrato se retiene debito tempo acio che la uirtu digestiua possa perficere
la sua operatione circha quello: La quarta uirtu e expulsiua laquale
ha expellere le superfluita che se generano dal nutrimento ne la digestione.</p>

<p>Anche e da sapere che la natura nel corpo de lhuomo ha facto quatro
membri principali como quatro signori et aciascuno di loro li ha dato una
casa o uero uno palazo a sua custodia doue habite cum certe camare o uero
stantie che hano aseruirli al suo bisogno: El primo membro principale e
signore e el cerebro al quale li fece la natura el capo cum le sue circumstantie
per suo habitaculo e dette a questo membro che lui fusse principio e radice
de tuto el sentimento e moto de tuto el [folio 4 verso] corpo: dal quale tuti
li altri membri recceueno el sentire: e el mouere, &amp; a questo membri li dette
etiam cinque uirtu cognoscitiue exteriore cio e li cinque sentimenti e cinque
altre uirtu cognoscitiue interiore che deserueno a lo intellecto.</p>

<p>El secondo membro principale e signore si e el Core alquale la natura ha
dato la sua casa cio e el pecto cum le sue adiacentie: et aquesto membro li ha
dato la uirtu de la uita dal quale proceda la uita in tuti li altri membri como
da uno primo principio.</p>

<p>El terzo membro principale e signore e el Figato alquale dette la natura
per suo domicilio el uentre inferiore cum li altri membri circumstanti che
sono neccessarii a la sua operatione e dette a questo membro la uirtu nutritiua
chel fusse principio e radice del nutricare de tuti li membri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span></p>

<p>El quarto membro principale fu li testiculi e la sua casa e la bursa laquale
li contene et aquilli deserueno piu altri membri como poi se uedera et a questi
testiculi ha dato la natura la uirtu generatiua cio e de generare el sperma
o uero seme el quale habia una uirtu generatiua che possa produre una cosa
simile a colui dal quale se decide tale sperma: et questo fu facto per conseruare
lhuomo in spetie non se possendo conseruare in indiuiduo.</p>

<p>Ultra questi quatro membri principali e suoi domicilii [folio 5 recto] ha
facto la natura alcuni altri membri cio e el collo cum la gola che fusse uia
e transito dal primo membro principale cio e cerebro ali altri membri principali
et etiam a tute laltre parte &amp; per altre utilita quale noi da poi diremo.</p>

<p>Item ha facto la natura le braza e le mane che hauesseno a pigliare el
cibo e mandarlo al luoco conueniente et etiam per che lhuomo solo uiue per
arte lequale non se possono perficere senza le braza e mano.</p>

<p>Item fece le cosse, gambe e piedi acio se potesse mouere da luocho a luocho
secondo li soi bisogni.</p>

<p>Fece la natura el capo ossuoso per magiore tutela del cerebro: el quale
essendo inmobile non li bisogno hauere musculi: Et per che el cerebro ne
lhuomo e magiore che ne li altri animali secondo la sua grandeza impero
bisogno chel capo de lhuomo fusse etiamdio grande per rispecto de li altri
animali: Et etiam bisogno li meati del capo ne lhuomo essere piu distincti
essendo piu dedito al cognoscere.</p>

<p>La figura [folio 5 verso] del capo naturale e rotonda compressa da dui
canti como sel fusse una cera rotonda compressa cum le mano da la parte
drita e da la stancha faria doe eminentie una dinanzi e laltra de drieto e la
parte drita e stancha rimaneriano piane: Bisogno fusse rotondo acio fusse
pin capace et etiam che fusse piu securo e risguardato da nocumenti exteriori
a li quali e molto exposito: Bisogno etiam essere facto cum quelle eminentie
acio che li meati del cerebro hauesseno megliore distinctione et acio che li
cinque sentimenti exteriori hauesseno origine da la eminentia anteriore.</p>

<p>Diece sono le parte del capo: La prima e li capilli quasi capitis pili facti
da la natura a magiore tutela del capo da le cose exteriore et etiam per
belleza: La seconda parte del capo e la cute la quale bisogno essere molto
grossa acio che li capilli fusseno ben firmi hauendo le radice sue molte grosse
e longhe et etiam che fusse megliore scuto e cooperimento de losso et del
cerebro non li essendo parte musculose: La terza parte si e la carne laquale
solo e ne la fronte e ne le tempie e circha le masselle e non in le altre parte:
La quarta parte e uno panniculo exteriore chiamato almochatim elquale
appare in continenti como e liuata su la cute e copre tuto losso del craneo
de fuora: Et fece la natura questo panniculo [folio 6 recto] acio che lacute
che e molle non tochasse incontinenti losso che e duro: Et etiam acio che
losso del capo hauesse sentimento per questo panniculo: Et tertio anche
acio che el paniculo interiore del capo chiamato Duramater mediante questo
panniculo stesse suspeso a losso del craneo cum certi nerui e ligamenti che
escono per le comissure del dicto osso et hano origine dal dicto panniculo
interiore &amp; uscendo fuora de losso texono o uero componeno quello panniculo
exteriore dicto Almochatim: La quinta parte e el craneo cioe osso facto<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
como uno capello nela concauita del quale glie locato el cerebro: &amp; in
questo craneo furno quatro ossa cusite insieme e la natura non fece questo
osso uno ma de piu pezi acio che achadando nocumento in una parte
non comunicasse a laltre parte: Et etiam acio che per quelle comissure
o uero cusiture potesseno meglio exhalare fuora le fumusitade dal cerebro:
Et tertio acio che bisognando la uirtu de le medicine applicate potesseno
meglio penetrare ale parte dentro quisti aduncha quatro pezi de osso furno
da la natura cusiti et insieme ionti in modo de denti acio fusse piu fermi
e forti et non furno facti in modo che se potesseno uincare como fano le
iunture per che non seriano state cusi forte: et etiam [folio 6 verso] per che
non bisognaua a losso del capo mouerse: Et queste comissure sono cinque
cio e tre uere e doe mendose: Le comissure uere sono quelle che passano
tuto losso et le mendose non passano: De le uere comissure una si e ne la
parte anteriore chiamata coronale et e facta a modo de uno C e protende
da la parte drita a la stancha del capo et ha li branchi uerso la fronte. La
secunda comissura uera si protende per la longheza del capo comencianda
da la comissura coronale ala parte posteriore como una friza o uero sagitta
che uene da larcho, impero e chiamata sagitale <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;(.</span> La terza comissura

chiamato dal greco lauda: e la comissura sagittale protende da la coronale

<p>Le comissure mendose sono due da ciascaduno lato una cio e dal drito
e dal stanco e sono dicte corticate per che non passano.</p>

<p>Et se noi consideremo per queste cinque comissure hauemo quatro ossi
cusiti insieme: Uno si e losso de la fronte che comenza dala comissura
coronale e termina uerso la parte inferiore a una altra comissura la quale
comenza da uno brancho de la comissura coronale e procede a presso le
ciglie de li ochii a laltro brancho Ɑ. Laltro osso si e de drieto el [folio 7
recto] quale se termina a la comissura laudale e dui altri ossi da le tempie
che se terminano da le comissure mendose le quale comenzano da la comissura
laudale a la comissura coronale.</p>

<p>La sexta parte sono doi paniculi uno chiamato Dura mater el quale e in
continenti de poi el craneo: e laltro se chiama pia mater el quale incontinente
copre el cerebro e questo fece la natura hauendo grande solicitudine di
questo membro acio che in continenti non fusse tocho da losso ma processe
per piu mezi che uno fusse piu duro che laltro: Et anche fece dui panniculi
acio che se la cadesse nocumento in uno de loro non comunicasse al cerebro
in continente. Ne la pia matre sono texute certe uene per le quale se nutrisse
el cerebro e si lo copre per tuto excepto la parte posteriore per che essendo
quella parte sicca non bisogno di questo paniculo como la parte anteriore
e meza. Questi dui panniculi in piu luochi penetrano la sustantia del cerebro
et se lo diuide in parte drita e parte sinistra et in parte anteriore &amp; parte
posteriore: et per queste tale diuisione furno fabrichate nel capo diuerse
celule o uero camerette ne le quale produce lanima diuerse operatione per
che bisognaua che queste tale parte fuseno de diuerse complexione.</p>

<p>E leuati adoncha questi dui panniculi apparera La [folio 7 verso] Septima
parte del capo: et e esso cerebro facta da la natura acio che el spirito uitale
mandato dal core calidissimo sia contemperato da la frigidita de esso cerebro:
et iue douenti spirito animale elquale e principio de le operatione cognoscitiue
&amp; motiue: e questo cerebro e una sustantia medulare biancha molle
e uiscosa a cio che da essa hauesseno origine li nerui: ma la parte dinanci
fu generata piu humida e molle &amp; mancho frigida che la parte posteriore
per che da la parte anteriore hano origine li sentimenti li quali sono molli
&amp; humidi ma da la parte posteriore hano origine li nerui motiui li quali<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
bisognano essere piu sicci e forti: Questo cerebro aduncha se diuide in tri
uintriculi oucro tre parte: El primo uentriculo o parte anteriore e diuisa
in doe, cio e dextra e sinistra: et e magiore che nesuno de li altri uentriculi:
et in questo primo uentriculo li pose la natura doe uirtu deseruente al cognoscere
una se chiama senso comune doue se terminano li altri sensi exteriori
como al suo centro et deferiscono le imagine o uero spetie de le cose sensiue
a quello luocho acio che quella uirtu cognosca e distingua tra una cosa sensibile
e laltra et etiam cognosca le operatione di li sentimenti particulari lequale
doe cose non puo fare nesuno de quilli.</p>

<p>Laltra uirtu de questo primo uentriculo se [folio 8 recto] chiama fantasia
et apresso alcuni se chiama imaginatiua laquale ha a retinere et conseruare
le spetie de le cose sensibile ne la absentia de le cose sensibile. Quando tu
harai ueduto el uentriculo primo tu uederai tre cose inanzi che uegni al
uentriculo secondo. La prima si e doe anche cio e una cosa facta de la sustantia
del cerebro in modo de doe anche che sono fundamento del uentriculo
anteriore cusi da la dextra como da la sinistra parte: et dal lato di ciascuna
ancha glie una altra cosa facta a modo de uno uerme subterraneo rosa se
sanguinea ligata de certi ligamenti e neruitti el quale uerme quando se
alonga chiude quelle anche et consequenter chiude la uia tra el primo uentriculo
et el secondo et questo fece la natura acio che lhuomo quando uole posse
cessare da le cogitatione e dal considerare et similiter quando uole considerare
e pensare questo uerme se contrahe et contrahendosi apre quelle anche
et consequenter apre la uia che e tra uno uentriculo e laltro: La terza cosa
che tu uederai un poco piu de sotta e una lacuna cio e una certa conchauita
rotonda che tra allongo nel mezio de laquale glie uno bucho che ua gioso al
palato et a questo bucho li occorre una uia drita laquale descende dal uentriculo
di mezo al colatorio e questa lacuna ha circumquaque eminentie grande
rotonde facte a sustentare [folio 8 verso] le uene et artharie che ascendeno
a dicti uentriculi: e quello bucho e lato di sopra e stretto in fonde e per questa
lacuna el primo e secondo uentriculo purgano le sue superfluitade benche
la parte anteriore piu se purghi per li colatorii del naso: Unde queste doe
uie fece la natura ad expurgare le superfluita del cerebro.</p>

<p>Quando adoncha tu hauerai ueduto queste tre cose incontinente te
apparera el secondo uentriculo del mezo el quale e como una uia et uno
transito dal primo uentriculo al posteriore: in questo uentriculo sono doe
uirtu una chiamata extimatiua, laquale ha elicere cose insensate da le cose
sensate. Laltra uirtu se chiama cogitatiua laquale cognosce cusi le cose sensate
como le cose insensate componendo e diuidendo: e questa uirtu in mediate
deserue a lo intellecto: et tute le altre uirtu dicte et anche la uirtu memoratiua
se ritrouano ne li animali bruti, ma questa solo se retruoua ne lhuomo.</p>

<p>Dapoi te occorrera el terzo uentriculo situato ne la parte posteriore duro
per che e principio de la piu parte di nerui motiui liquali bisogno essere piu
forti e duri: Questo uentriculo e de figura pyramidale cio e facto in ponta e
la ponta si e ne la parte superiore doue ha aconseruare le spetie per che meglio
se riserua la cosa [folio 9 recto] in stretto luocho che in amplo: e la parte di
sotto e lata per che ha a receuere le spetie e meglio se receue in luocho amplo
che stretto: Due adoncha utilita se ha da questo uentriculo una che e principio
de la nucha e di li nerui mottiui. Laltra si e che e camera de la uirtu
memoratiua.</p>

<p>E per questo appare che quando e offesa la parte posteriore del capo in
continenti se offende la memoria e quando se offende la parte de mezo se
offende la uirtu extimatiua &amp; cogitatiua &amp; offesa la parte dinanzi se offende
el senso comune e la fantasia et in questo modo ueneno in cognitione li
medici de li luochi de le dicte uirtu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span></p>

<p>Facto questo tu leuarai el cerebro ligieramente chel non si rompa alcuno
neruo e comezarai da la parte di nanzi &amp; incontinenti te apparerano doe
carne picole in modo de doi capi de mamille simile ala sustantia de cerebro
per che nascono da quello et sono coperte dal paniculo subtile cio e da la
pia matre e queste sono lorgano de lo oderato doue e la uirtu olphatiua.</p>

<p>Dal cerebro nascono septe para de nerui: procedi adoncha piu oltra ne
la parte dinanci e uederai el primo paro de dicti nerui liquali sono grandi
chiamasi nerui obtitii de li quali la origine e dal cerebro ne li uentriculi
anteriori e procedeno uerso li ochii ma nanci che escano la pia matre se
coniongeno [folio 9 verso] et in luocho de la sua unione sono perforati:
Uolse Galieno che dicti nerui solo se coniongeseno o uero se unisseno e non
se incrutiasseno ma quello neruo che uiene dala parte drita da poi la unione
ritorna pure dala parte drita et similiter quello che uiene da la parte sinestra
da poi la unione ritorna uerso lochio sinistro: Ma Rasis uolse el contrario
benche la opinione de Galieno sia piu comune: questi nerui deserueno al
uedere e fu necessario che se uniseno acio che le spetie de la cosa che se uede
receuuta in doi ochii e portata per doi nerui ritorni a unita acio che una
cosa non appara doe.</p>

<p>Dapoi li dicti nerui leua el cerebro secondo la sua medieta e uederai
uno altro pare de nerui subtili et duri li quali uengono similiter a li ochii
a darli el mouimento uoluntario componendo certi musculi.</p>

<p>Da poi tu uederai el terzo pare de nerui di quali una parte se ne ua ala
faza a darli el sentire e el mouere uoluntario et anche una parte de quisti
ua a dare el gusto a la lengua: Un altra parte de dicti nerui se mescola
insieme cum el quarto<a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> pare de nerui et descendeno insieme gioso a dare
sentimento al Diafragma et al stomaco et alaltre uiscera: Una certa parte
de li nerui del <span class="nowrap">quarto<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> pare se ne ua a dare el sentimento al palato.</p>

<p>Da poi e el quinto pare de nerui se ne ua a li ossi petrosi liquali sono
apresso [folio 10 recto] le orechie e de questi nerui ne li buchi de lorechie
se componeno certi panniculi liquali sono organo de lo audire.</p>

<p>Da poi e el sexto pare de nerui che se diuide in tre parte una parte
ua ali musculi de la gola: Laltra parte ua ali musculi de le spalle la terza
parte che e magiore de le altre descende gio a lo epyglotto e nel diafragma
se sparge nel pecto nel core e nel polmone a compagnandosi insieme cum
li nerui del terzo pare dicti: Et anche da li nerui di questo sexto pare
quali uadeno gio a lo epyglotto se generano li nerui de la uoce chiamati
reuersiui dili quali piu disotto se uedera.</p>

<p>Dapoi e el septimo pare de nerui ha origine da la parte posteriore del
cerebro e uadeno a dare el mouimento a la lingua uoluntario: De questi
septe para de nerui li primi doi pari hano origine da la anteriore parte del
cerebro: el terzo pare ha origine dal mezo de lanteriore e posteriore parte:
li altri quatro para de nerui hano origine da la parte posteriore.</p>

<p>E dapoi quisti procedendo piu oltre leua tuto el cerebro &amp; apparera la
octaua parte del capo cioe doi panniculi posti sotto el cerebro li quali leuati
apparerati la nona parte che e una certa rethe laquale se chiama rethe
mirabile per che e contexta de una tessetura fortissima et miraculosa multiplicata
de certe artharie sutilissime: lequale sono [folio 10 verso] rami de
alcune artharie che ascendeno dal core chiamate artharie apopletice: &amp; in
queste artharie di questa rethe se contiene el spirito uitale mandate dal
core acio che douenti animale: et acio che questo spirito meglio se alterasse
e disponesse fece la natura quelle artharie sutilissime diuise per minime<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
parte acio che questo spirito fusse diuiso anche in minime parte: et pose
la natura questa rethe mirabile sotto el cerebro perche bisogno hauere de
molta custodia onde lo situo in luoco tutissimo et etiam acio che le humidita
uaporese del cerebro che cadeno sopra questa rethe opilandola inducesse el
somno naturale.</p>

<p>Da poi tute queste cose uederai losso basilare che e la decima et ultima
parte del capo e chiamasi basilare per che e base e fondamento de tuto el
capo e fu facto duro acio che le superfluita che descendono a lui non lo
putrefesse: e questo osso e diuiso in molti altri ossi como se puo uedere
cociandelo. Onde se diuide ne le osse petrose e ne li ossi del naso e ne le ossi
de li ochii &amp; in doi altri ossi laterali li quali non se possono uedere se non
per uia de decocione.</p>
</div>

<p class="tac"><i>Capitulum tertium de anothomia oculorum et membrorum deseruientium

<div class="it">
<p>Le ossa del naso forno cauernose e porrose acio che le superfluita del
cerebro possano meglio de [folio 11 recto] scendere e lo odore ascendere.</p>

<p>Dapoi scinde tuti doi li ossi de gliochii e uederai la colligantia loro cum
li nerui obtitii e cum li nerui motiui: e el loco de li ochii non fu molto in
profondo per che douca receuere le spetie de le cose uisibile: ne anche
fu tropo eminente acio non receuesse lesione da le cose exteriore: Et essendo
li ochii molto molli e passibili ne lhuomo fece la natura li supercilii acio
fusseno custoditi da le cose che descendeno de su in gioso e fece le palpebre
che fuseno custoditi da le cose che uengono da fuora dentro: e fece le
eminentie de le maxille et anche el naso in mezo che da ogne lato e per
ogne uerso fusseno custoditi: tanto fu la solicitudine che hebe la natura di
questo membro.</p>

<p>Septe sono le tuniche e tri humori di liquali e composto lochio tre
tuniche anteriore se coiongeno cum tre altre posteriore como se fusseno sei
scutelle che cum la bocha ogne doe se coniongesseno e che doe fussene
magiore che contineseno le altre doe e poi li e la septima tunica che e magiore
de tute e contene tuto lochio: e pero se chiama coniontiua per che congionge
e circunda tuto lochio excepto el luocho de la pupilla e quello pocho
de la cornea che appare e questa e la prima tunicha comenzando da le
parte de fuora et e biancha.</p>

<p>La seconda tunicha ne la parte dinanci se si chiama cornea, [folio 11 verso]
per che se asomiglia al corno quanto ala substantia e quanto al colore:
e fu questa tunicha transparente acio che le spetie de le cose uisibile potesseno
penetrare per essa e fu etiam sollida e grossa composita de quatro pellicule
e questo fu per che e propinqua a le cose exteriore non receuesse nocumento
da esse e cum questa tunicha ne la parte posteriore se conionge un altra
tunica dicta scliroticha cio e dura e queste doe tuniche hano origine dal
paniculo di sotto el craneo cio e da la dura matre cusi como la prima tunicha
ha origine dal panniculo disopra el craneo dicto almochatim.</p>

<p>La quarta tunicha ne la parte dinanzi se chiama uuea a similitudine
de uno grano de uua negra et in el mezo di quella glie uno buco che se chiama
la pupilla: fece la natura questa tunica obscura acio chel spirito uisiuo
se confortasse e che non si resoluesse dal lume exteriore: e fece quello
buco in questa tunica acio che le spetie potesseno penetrare senza impedimento
e fecelo stretto acio chel spirito uisiue fusse unito: Onde quando
dicta pupilla o uero buco se alargha oltra el debito o per natura o per accidente
se impedisse el uedere: e ne la parte de drieto se li coniongne la quinta

<p>La sexta tunicha se chiama ne la parte dinanzi aranea per che e facta
in modo de una tela de ragno a la quale ne la parte posteriore se li coniongne
la septima tunicha chiamata arethina per che e facta in modo de una rethe:
et in mezo de la tunicha uuea et de la aranea da la parte dinanzi glie uno
humore dicto albugineo facto a similitudine de uno albumo de ouo facto
per humettare lochio et acio che la tunicha cornea stia suleuata impero
in li homini che moreno quando questo humore se desicca cade la cornea
e se si spiana et a lhora dice el uulgo che appare una tela dinanzi da gliochii

apperta impero quando se sicca se stringe la pupilla: Nel meze de le due
ultime tuniche cio e aranea et arethina lequale hano origine da nerui obtitii

<p>Da poi tu uederai el palato el quale ha una certa concauita ne la sumittade

<p>Dapoi la uuula sono le fauce: e sono li luochi ampli glandosi disposti

<p>El domicilio adoncha del core si e el luocho del pecto circundato da le

anexa al palato sotto luuula e questa carne copre lorificio de essa canna<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
del polmone el quale orificio si chiama epiglotto: acio che ne lhora del
transglutire niente del cibo e del poto descendesce a la uia del polmone per
che indurebbe suffocatione: Impero aduiene che se uno ridendo transglutisse
qualche cosa ua al polmone et appare che lhuomo se soffochi per che
ne lhora del ridere se apre lo epiglotto: Lieua adoncha el meri da la trachea
artharia acio che tu uidi la compositione sua: ma sapii che el meri e la
trachea facilmente se seperano per insino al epyglotto cio e al orificio de
essa trachea ma circa lo epyglotto cum dificulta se seperano per che la tunica
del meri si e dispersa ne lo epyglotto: e questo fece la natura sagacemente acio
che ne lhora del transglutire del cibo quando [folio 17 verso] el meri se
lieua uerso la bocha ad atrahere el cibo anche lo epyglotto se lieua acio che
remanendo gioso per la sua dureza non impedisse el transito del cibo.</p>

<p>La trachea artharia o uero canna del polmone e composita de anuli
carthilaginosi e panniculosi e de ligamenti che continuano quilli anuli insieme
facta da la natura a transportare laiere al polmone per auentare el core:
&amp; a transportare fuora i uapori caldi da esso et etiam fu facta a formare la
uoce ne la sua extremita cio e ne lo epyglotto: Questa canna bisogno che
fusse carthilaginosa et alquanto dura et non pelliculare e molle perche
bisognaua stare aperta essendo uia de laiere: e non fu etiam ossuosa per
che douea essere flexibile per la formatione de la uoce: et anche se fusse
ossuosa impediria el transito del cibo per el meri quando fusse tropo: Et per
questa ragione la carthilagine di questa canna non fu una ma furno piu
continuate per certe pellicole insieme: e queste sono facte como certi semicirculi
in modo de uno C per che se fusse una carthilagine seria dura e comprimirebbe
el meri et impediria el transito del cibo. Onde questa cana ne
la parte anteriore e carthilaginosa per che uerso quella parte non tocha el
meri et anche acio che sia piu difesa da le cose exteriore ma uerso la parte
posteriore e pelliculare per insino a lo epyglotto: La quale poi tuta e carthilaginosa
[folio 18 recto] per la ragione dicta: e questa canna del pulmone
non descende se non insino a la furcula sotto laquale e incontinenti
situato el pulmone: et el sito de essa e ne la parte dinanzi: et dritamente procede
e non storta acio che laiere habbia piu libero ingresso: et lo epyglotto
che e principio di questa canna si e tuto carthilaginoso acio che sia piu
sonoro: et e apresso la bocha acio che sia instrumento dela uoce: laquale poi
ne la bocha douenta locutione per che la uoce finalmente ne lhuomo se ordina
al parlare. Questo epyglotto e composto de tre carthilagine e uinti musculi:
Una carthilagine si e ne la parte anteriore e chiamasi clipeale a modo de
uno capello: Laltra si e ne la parte posteriore uerso el meri e questa non
ha nome: La terza si e in mezo di queste doe et in essa e una lenguetta in modo
de una lingua de zalamella e chiamasi questa carthilagine fistula de lo
epyglotto per che como la fistula se ordina nel sono cusi questa carthilagine
si e ordinata al canto e la melodia: Questo epyglotto etiam e composto de
uinti musculi a dare el moto uoluntario secondo el bisogno de formare la uoce:
e dodeci di quisti sono da la parte di dentro e octo dala parte de fuori et
a quisti musculi uengono dui nerui che hano origine dal sexto pare de nerui
del cerebro dicti: di quali una parte descende per insino al core e poi comenza
a reascendere per insino a lo epyglotto impero [folio 18 verso] sono dicti
nerui reuersiui li quali sono nerui de la uoce e quando sono alo epyglotto se
spargeno inquisti uinti musculi a darli el sentire e el mouere. Questi nerui
forno reuersiui e non directi per molte cagione: prima acio [che] fusseno piu
forti per che quanto el neruo e piu remoto dal cerebro tanto e piu sicco e forte:
La seconda acio [che] fuseno facti a modo de uno freno da cauallo acio chel
cerebro meglio mouesse lo epyglotto secondo lo imperio de la sua uolunta
mediante questi nerui como lhuomo moue el cauallo al suo libito mediante<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
el freno: La terza cagione e per che la uoce non solo depende dal cerebro
como dal principio del moto uoluntario ma etiam depende dal core como da
quello nel quale se formano i concepti del cerebro et consequenter i concepti
de la uoce: bisogno adoncha che dicti nerui comunicasseno al core: La
quarta cagione e per che quisti nerui douendo uegnire ali musculi predicti
bisogno che uigniseno al principio de dicti musculi e non a la fine: et el
principio di quisti musculi de lo epyglotto e ne la parte inferiore.</p>

<p>Da poi la trachea artharia tu uederai el pulmone ala compositione del
quale concorreno piu parte ramificate como fili sutili ad ordire la sua substantia:
La prima parte che entra ne la substantia del polmone si e la
trachea artharia laquale [folio 19 recto] como gionge a la furcula del pecto
se diuide in doe parte: una ua al dritto e laltra al sinistro del pulmone e ciascuna
di quelle se diuide in doe altre parte cio e superiore et inferiore: e ciascuno
de quilli rami: se diuide etiam in rami minori e cusi diuidendosi peruengono
a rami minimi como fili e circundano tuta la substantia del pulmone.
Una altra parte che ordisse la substantia del pulmone si e una certa uena
che ha origine dal uentriculo dritto del core laquale porta el sangue sutile dal
core a nutrire el pulmone: e chiamasi uena arthariale Vena per che non
pichia arthariale per che e composta de doe tuniche como sono le artharie:
e questa uena se ramifica ne la substantia del pulmone como la trachea
artaria.</p>

<p>La terza parte che compone el pulmone si e una certa artharia che nasce
dal sinistro uentriculo del core dicta artharia uenale: Artharia per che
pichia Venale per che e composta de una tunica como le altre uene et per
questa artharia se transporta dal pulmone al core laiere che uiene da la
trachea artharia a refrigerare esso core: Et perquesta artharia etiam se manda
dal core al pulmone laiere e uapori caldi e dal polmone poi escono fuori per
essa trachea e questa artharia similiter se ramifica como le altre doe parte
predicte: Onde li rami de la trachea [folio 19 verso] e de lartharia uenale e
uena arthariale compongono tuto el pulmone in modo de una rethe: et i
buchi de questa rethe reimpisse una certe carne molle spongiosa laquale proprio
e substantia de esso pulmone: Et tute queste quatro parte predicte sono
inuolute da uno certo panniculo che ha origine da uno panniculo che e sotto le
coste chiamato pleura del quale poi se dira per questo panniculo ha el pulmone
el sentimento per che el pulmone non sente secondo la sua substantia.</p>

<p>Et nota che li rami de la trachea artharia sono magiori che li rami de la
uena arthariale, et de la artharia uenale per che nascono da magiore troncho
et etiam nota che el pulmone e magiore ne la parte dritta che ne la stancha
per che dal lato stancho glie el core che occupa quello luocho: Similiter
e magiore ne la parte posteriore che ne la parte anteriore: Questo membro sie
como flabello del core a refrigerarlo et etiam a mondificarlo da li uapuri che

e de excellente calidita impero bisogno che fusse de una figura che asomigliasse
a la figura del fuocho: e questa tale figura se chiama pigneale cio
e simile ala figura de una pigna laquale e lata disotto e strecta di sopra et di
tale figura fu facto acio che meglio se facessono distinctione de le sue cellule

nel mezo de tuto el corpo tolti uia glie extremi cio e nel mezo de le parte
superiore et inferiore: nel mezo de le parte dinanzi e de drieto, e nel mezo de

membri: E benche el core sia quanto al suo fondamento et ala sua base
nel mezo tamen secondo la sua ponta declina al lato stancho sotto la mamilla
sinistra acio che riscaldasse la parte sinistra como el figato riscalda la parte
dritta: e questo [folio 20 verso] membro se sustenta e ferma de uno certo osso
cartilaginoso per che e in continuo mouimento: bisogno aduncha che hauesse
uno apogiamento alquale se fermasse nel suo mouimento: Et e etiam composto
de una certa pinguedine ne la parte exteriore acio che prohibisca chel
core non se desichi tenendolo humectato: Et e composto di certe uene et
artharie disperse per la sua substantia: et e composto etiamdio de una certa
carne dura per che haueua a sustignire de molti e forti mouimenti: Et
etiam fu composto de uili longitudinali latitudinali e transuersali per che
bisognaua che hauesse uirtu de atrahere retignire et expellere: E questo
membro ha tri uentriculi o uero tre cellule como ha el cerebro. Uno uentriculo
e dal lato dritto e laltro dal lato stancho e el terzo e in mezo: el uentriculo
dritto uerso el figato: el quale ha doi orificii: uno e uerso el figato et
e molto grande nel quale entra una uena chiamata uena chilis laquale nasce
dal gibbo del figato e porta el sangue dal figato al core: Et in questo uentriculo
dextro del core se puriffica quello sangue e cusi purificato poi lo manda
el core a tuti li altri membri: e per che per questo orificio ha el core piu ad
atrahere che ad expellere impero ordino la natura che ne lhora de la constrictione
quando de expellere che questo orificio se chiudesse: e che [folio
21 recto] quando el core se dilatta se aprisse: Et iui sono tre hostiolitti
o uero usitti liquali se apreno da fuora adentro: e questi hostioli non sono
molto depressi e per che per questo medesimo orificio se expelle el sangue
depurato aglialtri membri ma non tuto per che una parte ua al polmone e de
laltra parte se ne fa spirito uitale: impero ordino la natura che quisti hostioli
non se chiudesseno in tuto: E da questa uena chilis inanzi che entri la
concauita del core nasce un altra uena laquale circunda la radice del core
e da quella nascono alcuni rami che se disparghono per la substantia del
core: E del sangue de questa uena se nutrisse esso core.</p>

<p>Uno altro orificio ha questo uentriculo destro uerso el pulmone nel quale
entra la uena arthariale che porta el sangue dal core a nutrire el pulmone:
Et in questo orificio li sono etiam tri hostioli liquali se apreno de la parte
dentro a la parte difuori e se chiudeno da la parte difuori a la parte di dentro
per el contrario di li hostioli de laltro orificio: e questo e per che in tuto
se chiudeno: Onde per questo orificio el core ne lhora de la constrictione
solo ha ad expellere: e ne lhora de la sua dilatatione non ha ad atrahere
alcuna cosa como faceua nel primo orificio.</p>

<p>El uentriculo sinistro del core ha i lati piu densi e piu spissi che li lati
o uero parieti del uentriculo dextro: e questo [folio 21 verso] fu per tre
ragione: La prima per che nel uentriculo dextro se de contenere el sangue
el quale e graue. E nel uentriculo sinistro se de continere el spirito el quale
e molto ligiero: acio aduncha chel core non fusse piu graue e ponderoso da<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
una parte che da laltra bisogno recompensare in questo modo cio e che lo
uentriculo stancho hauesse piu groseza ne li suoi parieti che el dextro: La
seconda cagione e che essendo el spirito piu suttile e piu resolubile chal sangue
bisogno adoncha che el suo habitaculo hauesse piu grosso e de megliore
sponde: La terza cagione si e per che el uentriculo sinistro e molto piu caldo
cha el dextro per che iui se genera el spirito dal sangue per una grande
calidita che suttiglia quello sangue e la calidita meglio se conserua nel
subiecto denso e grosso:</p>

<p>Ne la concauita di questo uentriculo circa la sua radice li sono dui orificii:
uno si e lorificio de una artharia chiamata artharia adorti per che inmediate
ha origine dal core e per che e principio de la origine de tute le altre: per
laquale artharia manda el core el spirito generato a tuti i membri: et etiam
el sangue molto suttile insieme cum el spirito e questo fa quando el core se
constringe: Onde nel principio di questo orificio li sono tri hostioli liquali
in tuto se chiudeno da la parte difuori a quella dentro: e se se apreno da
la parte dentro a la parte difuori e questo [folio 22 recto] orificio e molto
profundo.</p>

<p>Laltro orificio si e de lartharia uenale laquale transporta laiere dal polmone
a refrigerare el core e transporta i uapori caldi dal core al polmone como
e stato dicto disopra: Et in questo orificio li sono doi hostioli che non se
chiudeno altuto: Et sono molto eleuati acio che se apogiono melglio a la
sponda del core quando el manda el spirito: Queste sono mirabile opere de
la natura como anche mirabile opera fu nel uentriculo mezo del core per che
questo uentriculo non ha una concauita ma piu lequale sono picole ma larghe
e piu nela drita parte che la sinistra: E questo fece la natura acio chel
sangue che ua dal drito uentriculo al sinistro per conuertersi in spirito
continuamente se uegna suttigliando per quelle concauita.</p>

<p>Et per questo tu poi uedere che dal core nascono quatro cose cio e lartharia
chiamata adhorti: Laltra si e la uena chilis: la terza si e la uena
arthariale: e la quarta si e artharia uenale.</p>

<p>Anche uederai nel core certe parte pelliculare &amp; in modo de auricule o uero
orechiette apte a dillatarsi e constringersi facte da la natura acio che quando
nel core se genera molto sangue o molto spirito se potesse el core dilatare
a contenire quello sangue o quello spirito multiplicato et anche se constrinza
quando non glie tanta habundantia di sangue o de spirito.</p>

<p>E qui adimanda Galieno [folio 22 verso] per che non fece la natura el
core si grande che potesse continere ogne multitudine di sangue e de spirito
senza quilli adittamenti di quelle pellicule. Risponde Galieno che questo
fu: prima perche el core seria stato tropo grande: et consequenter tropo
ponderoso: Secundario per che non se generando sempre molta quantita de
sangue o de spirito sel core fusse stato tropo grande per la piu parte de le
uolte la concauita del core seria stata uacua: ma queste tale auricule se
dillatano ne lo aduenimento del sangue o del spirito e cusi se stringono ne la
paucita soa.</p>

<p>Questo core e circumdato da uno panniculo duro neruoso o uero pelliculare
facto in modo de una cassetta nel quale e posto el core como in uno suo
tabernaculo a diffensarlo da le cose occurrente: Et e questa capsula molto
dilatata acio chel core ne la sua dillatatione e mouimento non fusse agrauato
da essa: Et etiam fece la natura questa capsula acio che continesse una
certa aquosita rorida de laquale se bagnasse et humetasse el core acio che
per el suo continuo mouimento non se sichasse: Onde quando questa aqua
che e ne la capsula del core sie desiccata etiam se desicca esso cuore et consequenter
se demacra e desicca tuto el corpo.</p>

scilicet mediastine, pleure, &amp; diafragmatis.</i></p>

<div class="it">
<p>[folio 23 recto] Tri sono li panniculi interiori diquesto domicilio del core:
Uno che se chiama mediastino che diuide la concauita del pecto per mezo
cio e la parte dinanzi da la parte de drieto et consequenter diuide el polmone
per mezo: e questo panniculo non e neruoso ne anche e ueramente uno
continuo como li altri paniculi: e questo ha facto la natura per alcune
utilita: prima acio che se una parte del polmone receuesse nocumento di
qualchi superflui humuri che se agregasseno in quella non peruegnisse el
nocumento e non regurgitasse quella materia a laltra parte; Secundario
acio che tenesse suspeso e ligato el polmone al pecto.</p>

<p>El secondo panniculo chiamato pleura e uno panniculo duro e neruoso
e molto grande: el quale copre tute le coste da la parte dentro: impero ha
colligantia cum tuti li membri liquali se contengono ne la concauita del
pecto e questo panniculo fece la natura acio che cuprisse tuti quilli membri
a sua tutela; et acio che li paniculi dili membri tuti del pecto hauesseno principio
et origine da quello.</p>

<p>El terzo panniculo se chiama Diafragma e da Aristotile e chiamato diazona
per che e como una cintura che cinge per mezo: Questo panniculo e musculoso
cio e carnoso e neruoso et e situato ne la fine del pecto e de le coste
e ne la parte dinanzi quanto a la parte sua [folio 23 verso] carnosa e continuato
cum le carthilagine de le coste mendose, e ne la parte posteriore
e continuato cum la duodecima spondile doue sono le rene: De le coste e di
li spondili poi noi diremo.</p>

<p>La utilita de questo panniculo prima fu acio chel seperasse li membri
spirituali da li membri naturali cio e el secondo domicilio dal terzo acio che
li fumi leuati da le feze non peruegniseno a li membri spirituali: Secundario
per che ha a mouere el pulmone al mouimento de lo hanelito: e questo
panniculo benche cingha per mezo oblique tamen et non ex directo: e la
cagione di questa obliquita sie che da questo panniculo insieme cum el
myrach del quale poi noi diremo se comprimino le feze che sono ne
lintestini ne lhora de la egestione como se fusseno tra doe asse de uno
torchio: E quanto a la parte meza di questo panniculo laquale e neruosa
e panniculosa e colligato cum el pulmone per darli el mouimento como e stato
dicto mediante i nerui quali uengono ad esso dal cerebro e da la nucha e per
questo appare la cagione de la diuersita de el Diafragma e de li altri musculi
per che li altri musculi nel luocho doue se congiongeno cum el membro quale
debeno mouere sono como corde e ne li altri luochi sono carnosi per che sono
facti principaliter a mouere le osse: ma nel diafragma e tuto el contrario per
che fu instituito principalmente [folio 24 recto] a mouere el pulmone e non le
ossa, e per questo appare chel diafragma sie rotondo cum una certa longitudine
e che la sua substantia e musculosa e cordosa e che le utilitade sue
sono tre: Prima acio che sia principio del moto de lo hanelito: Secundo acio
che diuida tra membri spirituali e naturali: Tertio acio che aiuti el mirach
ad expellere le superfluita quale sono ne lintestini.</p>

<p>Dicto di li membri che sono contenuti dentro dal pecto: poniamo adesso
la anothomia de esso pecto: e disopra habiamo dicto che glie uno paniculo
chiamato pleura quale copre tute le coste da la parte di dentro: Da poi quello<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>

spondili che sono como sponde doue se apogiano le coste lequale sono dodece
da ciascuno lato cio e septe uere e cinque mendose: Le coste uere sono continuate
cum li spondili a coprire et perficere el pecto: ma le mendose non:
et una costa non attinge laltra ne la extremita acio che meglio se possa
dilatare e constringere el pecto: Li spondili sono septe che se coniungono
cum le septe coste uere mediante certe cartilagine lequale sono tra luno e
laltro: e da queste carthilagine cum le sue ossa [folio 24 verso] se compone
uno membro chiamato la furcula del pecto facta a modo de una furcula bifurchata;
e ne la extremita sua li e una certa carthilagine facta a modo de uno
scuto a custodire la bocha del stomaco e chiamasi pomo granato: Da li
lati de le coste mendose sono certe carthilagine.</p>

<p>Da poi uenendo a le parte de fuora: sono alcuni musculi di li quali alcuni
sono a dillatare el pecto e sono dui musculi del Diafragma posti ne le parte
inferiore del pecto: et hano a dillatare el Diafragma et consequenter el pecto
ne la parte inferiore doue e una grande spaciosita: Item li sono dui altri
musculi liquali sono nel collo et hano a dillatare la concauita superiore del
pecto la quale e picola. Item sono altri musculi ne la schina doue e la origine
de le coste, e comenzano apresso la origine de la prima costa: Item sono
molti altri musculi picoli liquali cum difficulta se possono uedere ne la
anothomia: e tuti quisti musculi predicti sono solo a dillatare.</p>

<p>Alcuni altri musculi sono a dilatare e constringere e sono situati tra le
coste perche tra ciascune doe coste li sono doi musculi di liquali uno ha li
uili latitudinali a dillatare, e laltro ha li uili transuersali a constringere.</p>

<p>Oltra questi musculi appare la pinguedine le mamille e la cute: La cute
e la pinguedine e asai manifesta [folio 25 recto] impero solo noi direme de la
anothomia de le mamille e haueremo fornito la anothomia del secondo domicilio
e del secondo membro principale.</p>
</div>

<p class="tac"><i>Capitulum sextum de anothomomia mamillarum et de utilitatibus earum.</i></p>

<div class="it">
<p>La figura de le mamille si e in modo de una cucha rotonda per che bisognaua
essere capace del sangue che se ha a connetere in lacte e la figura
rotonda e piu capace cha le altre: et etiam per che le mamille sono como
scuto del core impero doueano hauere una figura piu secura da li nocumenti:
e questa tale figura e la rotonda.</p>

<p>Le mamille hebbeno doi capi picoli acio che la creatura potesse suciare
el lacte: E la substantia sua si e certe carne glandose le quale de sua natura
sono frigide acio che el sangue douenti biancho in esse e questo non se fa
senon per infrigidatione del dicto sangue.</p>

<p>La quantita de le mamille ne la dona e magiore che nel maschio per che
bisognaua generare el lacte ne la dona e non nel maschio. Et etiam essendo
la femina piu frigida chel maschio bisogno essere magiore le mamille in esse
acio che facesseno magiore reuerberatione del caldo al core et per questa
reuerberatione lo fortifficaseno.</p>

<p>Le mamille ne lhuomo forno facte due como in tuti li altri animali che
generano una o doe creature: ma ne [folio 25 verso] glialtri animali che
generano piu figlioli sono facte piu mamille.</p>

<p>Ne lhuomo forno situate nel pecto e ne li altri animali nel uentre: e questo
fu per molte casone: La prima secondo Galieno e chel sangue del quale se
genera el lacte deba essere ben digesto impero bisogno essere propinque al
core ne lhuomo per la cui calidita quello sangue fusse meglio digesto: ma ne
li altri animali molta quantita de tale sangue superfluo ua a conuertirse in
corni o in altri membri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span></p>

<p>La seconda cagione asegna Aristotile che li altri animali hano le gambe
dinanzi molto strette et impero hano el pecto molto stretto: ma ne lhuomo
el pecto e amplo: onde non potete la natura situare le mamille ne glialtri
animali como ne lhuomo.</p>

<p>La terza cagione si e chel core de lhuomo hebbe bisogno de essere piu
deffensato che el core de li altri animali li quali li hano pili disopra impero
fece la natura le mamille como defensaculo ne lhuomo che non ha pili inquelle
parte.</p>

<p>Le mamille hano colligantia cum el core e cum el figato per una certa uena
che ascende dal figato ad esse mamille: ha etiam dio colligantia cum la
matrice mediante certe uene che uengono da la matrice ad esse e procedeno

li membri che deserueno a la generatione non hanno distincto domicilio da li
membri nutritiui: E questo domicilio comenza dal pomo granato che copre
la bocha del stomaco del quale habiamo dicto e dura per insino al petenechio
inclusiue includendoli la uirga e li testiculi: et questo e quanto per lo longo, ma
quanto per el largo dura da uno fiancho a laltro e per el profondo dura da la
cute de lombelico che copre el corpo dinanzi dale coste ingioso per insino

<p>Inquesto domicilio li sono contenuti di molti membri cio e stomaco,

dui sono principali cio e el figato et li testiculi secondo Galieno, o uasi spermatici
secondo Aristotile.</p>

<p>Noi adoncha sequitaremo secondo el nostro ordine consueto comentiando
a li membri superiori e descendendo a linferiori. Comentiaremo [folio 26
verso] adoncha dal stomaco e dal meri che e uia del cibo ad esso stomaco,
E noi habiamo dicto di sopra che como la cana del pulmone era conducto de
laiere cusi el meri era conducto del cibo e del poto: E che la bocha de la
cana del pulmone e la bocha del meri erano congionte insieme per la rasone
iue dicta.</p>

<p>La sustantia di questo meri sie pelliculare e molle como la cana del
pulmone e pelliculare e carthilaginosa e bisogno chel meri fusse molle acio
potesse dilatarsi quando lhuomo piglia tropo cibo, et anche questo meri non
sta aperta como fa la cana del pulmone ma per la sua mollitie una parte cade
sopra laltra.</p>

<p>La subatantia del meri e composta de doe tuniche una intrinsecha che ha
certi uili o neruetti longitudinale che sono facti ad atrahere el cibo: e laltra
sie exteriore lie laquale sono uili latitudinali facti ad expellere quello che
e stato atratto da la tunicha interiore: benche la prima tunicha sie piu principale
che la seconda.</p>

<p>La quantita del meri e magiore che non e la quantita de la cana del
pulmone per che el meri ua piu longo che non fa essa cana: Onde el meri<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>
ua per insino al diafragma e desotto da esso se continua cum la bocha del
stomaco onde el stomaco e incontinenti sotto el diafragma: Et anche el
meri e magiore in largheza per che hauea a passare per esso cosa piu grosa che
non e [folio 27 recto] laiere.</p>

<p>Questo etiam Meri e posto piu nel profondo uerso le parte posteriore cio e
uerso la schina doue ua a ritrouare la bocha del stomaco laquale bocha e
uerso le parte posteriore: per che la bocha del stomaco e ligata ala schina
ex directo in el principio de la sua ligatura cio e a la decima terza spondile
sotto el diafragma: el quele se termina ala duodecima spondile e poi consequenter
procede el stomaco aligandosi ali spondili de le rene.</p>

<p>Questo stomaco sie cella del cibo et e quasi in mezo de tuto el corpo como
e stato dicto del core: per che essendo como lauezo doue se ha a cocere el
cibo bisogno essere in mezo acio chel receuesse calore da tute le parte e da
tuti li membri circumstanti: et non fu posto el stomaco apresso de la bocha
per la rasone dicta: Tu uederai adoncha el stomaco hauere sopra si el core
e el diafragma e desotto el misinterio e lintestini: da la parte dritta el figato
el quale lo abraza cum cinque sue penole: da la parte sinistra la milza
laquale li rende calore mediante le sue artharie: da la parte dinanzi ha una
rethe chiamata el Girbo: da la parte de drieto li musculi de la schina e una
uena grande e una artharia che passa per la schina como poi se uedera: da
tuti quisti membri receue calore el stomaco acio che coza bene el cibo.</p>

<p>E ben chel stomaco sia situato sopra de la Schina niente di meno la parte
sua superiore declina al [folio 27 verso] lato stancho, e la parte inferiore al
lato drito: e questo fu per che ne la parte dritta li e el figato molto eleuato
ne le parte superiore, e la milza ne la parte stancha e piu de pressa: impero
la parte superiore del stomaco non se potete locare ne la parte dritta per che
el figato occupaua quello luocho ma ben se potete locare ne la sinistra cio
e disopra dala milza doue li era uacuita. Item per che disotto dal figato li
sono glintestini suttili e gracili liquali occupano pocho luocho et iue remane
una grande concanita impero fu locata la parte inferiore del stomaco iue
a reimpire quella concauita: Et per che etiam ne la parte stancha disotto da
la milza apresse de le rene glie uno intestino molto grosso chiamato colon
el quale occupa uno grande luocho impero non se potete locare dicta parte
inferiore nel lato stancho.</p>

<p>Una altra cagione per laquale el stomaco non fu posto a presso de la
bocha e perche apresso de la bocha bisognorno essere i membri de lo hanelito
ad atrahere laiere: Et anche per che el bisognaua che glintestini fusseno
continuati cum el stomaco, e bisognaua che glintestini fusseno disotto dal
diafragma.</p>

<p>Et per questo appare che per molte cagione el stomac non fu locate per
el dritto ma per lo storto e per lo obliquo: la prima si e gia dicta acio reimpisse
la uacuita de la parte dritta e stancha: La seconda per che essendo
lhuomo de statura dritta non retigniria bene el cibo [folio 28 recto] ma
subito uscirebe fuori per la bocha disotto: La terza cagione per che bisognaua
chel stomaco receuesse da la milza quanto a la bocha superiore lhumore
melenconico a darli lapetito: et quanto a la bocha disotto bisono che
receuesse lhumore collerico dal figato: et impero bisogno che la bocha
superiore del stomaco fusse dal lato stanco doue e la milza e la bocha inferiore
fusse dal lato dritto doue e el figato.</p>

<p>E per questo appare chel stomaco ha colligantia cum la milza per certe
nene che portano lhumore melenconico ad esso: et ha similiter colligantia cum
el figato per molte altre uene che li portano el nutrimento dal figato: et ha
colligantia cum el core mediante una grande artharia che e posta sotto esso:
et ha colligantia cum el cerebro mediante uno certo neruo el quale ua ala<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
bocha del stomaco et iue se sparge e diuidese circa la superiore parte de esso
stomaco.</p>

<p>La figura del stomaco fu rotonda acio che fusse piu tuta da li nocumenti
extrinseci et acio anche che fusse piu capace per che bisognaua continere di
molto cibo: Ma non fu perfectamente rotonda per la rasone dicta per che
bisognaua che una parte declinasse al lato dritto e laltra al lato stanco impero
e di figura arcuale in modo de una cucha ritorta e fu molto grande el stomaco
acio potesse receuere grande quantita de cibo.</p>

<p>El stomaco e composto de due tuniche: Una interiore laquale e neruosa
e laltra [folio 28 verso] exteriore e carnosa: Et la prima tunica neruosa e piu
grossa e spessa che la seconda per che hauea a tochare el cibo acio che non
receuesse nocumento da esso e per che se potesse dilatare e constringere
secondo el bisogno de la quantita del cibo: ma la tunicha exteriore fu piu
suttile onde e da notare che la tunicha interiore bisogno essere neruosa per
molte rasone: prima per che in essa &amp; de essere lapetito e el sentimento e non
e dubio che meglio se sente la cosa quando senza mezo ocorre al sentimento:
ma la exteriore fu carnosa facta a digerire et alterare el cibo: la alteratione e
digestione se puo ben fare per mezo e non occorrendo in mediate a la cosa:
Questa tunicha adoncha exteriore e piu suttile che la interiore per che
e aiutata dai membri circumstanti a digerere: non bisogno essere adoncha
tropo grossa.</p>

<p>La tunicha interiore e deputata ad atrahere el cibo et a retignirlo debito
tempo per insino che se digestisse: impero ha alcuni uili longitudinali ne la
superficie interiore mediante li quali atrahe a se el cibo: e ne la superficie
exteriore ha alcuni uili transuersali per liquali ritiene el cibo: Et la tunicha
exteriore ha a digerire el cibo et consequenter ha ad expelerlo quando e
digesto: impero in essa certi uili latitudinali sono posti per liquali ha ad
expellere el cibo digesto:</p>

<p>La bocha del stomaco superiore e piu lata che non e la inferiore per che
[folio 29 recto] per la bocha disopra hauea intrare el cibo grosso indigesto e
per la bocha disotto hauea uscire el cibo suttile e digesto: E quisti doi orificii
non sono facti molto eminenti ma la parte inferiore del stomaco e piu disotto
che la bocha inferiore acio chel cibo se retegna et similiter la parte superiore
del stomaco e piu eminente e piu insuso che non e la bocha superiore acio che
essendo el stomaco pieno de cibo inclinandosi lhuomo cum la bocha in giu
non ritornasse el cibo fuora.</p>

<p>Doe adoncha sono le utilita del stomaco: Una ad appetere el cibo necessario
per tuto el corpo: e questo fa per la tunicha neruosa interiore
e laltra e a digerere el cibo e questo fa per la tunica exteriore carnosa.</p>

<p>Dapoi il stomaco li sequitano glintestini li quali sono sei reuoluti cioe
tri suttili e tri grossi et non fu ne lhuomo uno solo intestino recto ma furno
piu e circumuoluti acio chel cibo longo tempo se continesse nel stomaco et
intestini per che se cusi non fusse bisogneria che lhuomo fusse in continua
asumptione de cibo, et in continua egestione e seria stato lhuomo molto
occupato in tale uile operatione: Et anche sel fusse stato uno solo intestino
recto non seria stato tuto el cibo da ciascuna parte de lo [folio 29 verso]
intestino toco et consequenter non seria stato exsiccata tuta lhumiditade
del cibo: Acio adoncha tuta la humidita del cibo sia desiccata et atratta al
figato e che niente o pocha non rimanga ne le feze: Furno facti piu intestini<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>
circumuoluti: El primo adoncha intestino e chiamato duodeno et e suttile
e chiamasi duodeno perche e longo quanto e dodice uolte el dito grosso di
quello tale: Et in questo intestino li entra el cibo como e digesto nel stomaco
per la bocha de sotto de esso stomaco chiamata portonaria o uero pylerum
cum la quale se continua questo intestino duodeno. Digesto andoncha el
cibo nel stomaco se apre questo portonario e manda la uirtu expulsiua del
stomaco questo tale cibo ne lo intestino duodeno: A questo intestino ua
uno canale o uero condutto dal fele per el quale se porta la collera ad esso
intestino. Da poi questo intestino li sequitan uno altro intestino suttile
chiamato ieiuno perche e la piu parte del tempo uacuo per doe ragione:
Prima per che e dritto e non inuoluto: La seconda per che una grande
multitudine de collera pura uiene ad esso per quello medesimo condutto che
ua al duodeno: e questa collera mordica lo intestino e fa descendere gioso
el cibo.</p>

<p>Dapoi sequita el terzo intestino suttile chiamato ileon per che e situato
circa gli ilii id est li fianchi: Onde in questo intestino glie uiene el dolore
iliaco cio e dolore de fianco e questo [folio 30 recto] intestino hebbe molte
inuolutione, et anche ad esso peruengono de molte uene picole dal figato chiamate
mesaraiche: E questo fece la natura acio che el figato atrahesse la
humorosita dal cibo per quelle uene, onde a questo intestino li peruengono
piu uene mesaraiche che nesuno di li altri.</p>

<p>Dapoi questi tri intestini sutili sucedeno li grossi: E questo fu facto per
che quanto el cibo uiene piu descendendo tanto piu douentano dure le feze
e piu grosse impero bisogno che glintestini inferiori fusseno piu ampli che
li superiori.</p>

<p>El primo adoncha intestino grosso che sequita ali suttili si e chiamato
monoculo, non per che habia solo uno oreficio per che questo seria impossibile
anzi ne ha doi como li altri uno per elquale atrahe el cibo e laltro per
elquale expelle: ma per che quisti doi oreficii inquesto intestino sono uno
a presso de laltro como coiuncti e non dispartiti como ne glialtri impere appare
hauere solo uno oreficio, onde per questo monoculo e chiamato: Et anche
chiamato sacco per che pende la sua concauita como un sacco stando li suoi
orificii de sopra: Questo intestino e situato ne la parte dritta apresso lancha
e disotto dal rognone dritto. E fu facto acio che retinesse el cibo ançi lo reuerberase
a li intestini superiori e prohibisse che non descendesse acio che in
quilli intestini se esuccasse dal figato la sua humidita como e stato dicto.</p>

<p>Da poi questo intestino sequita laltro grosso [folio 30 verso] chiamato
colon per che ha piu colli o uero cellule ne lequale el stercho recceue la sua
forma.</p>

<p>Questo intestino ha de molte inuolutione circa el rognon stancho e poi
ascende e copre la milza e poi se declina a la parte dritta uendo piu uerso
le parte exteriore e copre el stomaco.</p>

<p>E per questo appare la cagione per che fu locato sopra del stomaco e de
sopra tuti li altri intestini: questo fu per che era piu ignobile de lialtri, e como
membro piu ignobile fu posto uerso le parte exteriore et anche per che le
feze se indurano in esso acio che hauesse qualche humidita dal girbo del
quale poi noi uederemo. Laltra cagione de cio e che essendo questo intestino
facto a continere et expellere le feze ma piu ad expelere impero bisognaua
ad esso uenire piu collera che hauesse a stimulare la uirtu expulsiua piu che
ne glialtri: impero sopra di quello ne la parte dritta una penula del figato
doue e alligata la cesta del fele como appare al sentimento: e questo fu che
de sopra de questo intestini li peruenisse la collera oltra quella che ua a la
sua concauita como etiam ua a le concauita de glialtri intestini.</p>

<p>La substantia di questo intestino e grossa e sollida facta cusi per la<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
uentosita grande che se genera in esso laquale fa dolore fortissimo chiamato
dolore collico: Et in questo intestino se generano certi uermi longi [folio
31 recto] et altre manerie de uermi chiamati lombrici.</p>

<p>Da poi e lultimo intestino chiamato intestino dritto de el quale la extremita
et oreficio inferiore se chiama ano o uero culo: e uasene uerso el
fiancho stancho doue poi comenza lo intestino colon predicto. In questo
intestino recto li sono una grande moltitudine de uene meserayce che uengono
a sugare se qualche humidita fusse rimasta ne le feze.</p>

<p>Quisti sono adoncha li sei intestini liquali sono alligati a la schina mediante
uno certo membro chiamato misinterio o uero intriglio quasi interiora
tenens che non solo glintestini ma tute le uiscere sono alligate per questo

<p>Vediamo mo del terzo membro principale situato in questo palazo et
e el figato alquale deseueno tuti li altri membri che sono posti quiue. El
figato naturalmente e situato sotto el diafragma et non sotto le coste uere,
ma una parte de esso sta sotto le parte mendose: benche ne lhuomo morto
appara essere locato tuto sotto le coste, e questo e per che li membri spirituali
ne lhumo morto sono molto anihilati et el figato ua a reimpire le uacuita
derelicte: impero quando tu fai la anothomia tu dei eleuare el corpo morte
e tirare in gioso el figato acio chel uada al suo luocho naturale.</p>

<p>La quantita del figato fu molto granda ne lhuomo per che e molto sanguineo
e de natura calda e humida.</p>

<p>El figato sie composto de certe uene diuise e disperse in modo de una rethe
et le uacuita sue reimpisse una certa carne rossa che e como sangue coagulato:
Et per queste uene se si sparze el cibo digesto nel stomaco chiamato chile
cio facto in modo de suco dorzo che cusi douenta nel stomaco, e questo fu
facto acio che se diuidesse in parte picole che tuto el figato potesse tochare
tuto quello chilo acio che meglio lo conuertisse in sangue: Ma nel stomaco
non sono tal uene done se hauesse a receuere el cibo ma solo [folio 32 recto]
li fece una concauita per che li cibi che se pigliano sono molto grossi che non
harebono potuto penetrare per dicte uene. Questa decocione che se fa
nel figato a conuertere el chile in sangue piu se compisse ne la parte superiore:
et impero quella parte e piu solida e dura: Hebbe el figato cinque penule
benche ne lhuomo non siano sempre diuise che se possano uedere.</p>

<p>Questo figato ha doe parte cio e la parte gibosa e la parte concaua, et ha
colligantia cum el core per una certa uena che nasce dal suo gibo e uasene

al diafragma e ala schina e laltre chel copre e sel circunda. Dala gibosita
sua nasce la uena chilis laquale porta el sangue al core de laquale habiamo
gia dicto. E da la parte sua concaua ne nasce unaltra chiamata porta o uero
uena concaua e questa uena ha cinque rami: cusi como sono cinque penule
del figato ne le quale entrano quisti cinque rami. E poi quando escono fuora
del figato sono da poi otto de lequale doe sono molte picole che male se
possono discernere ma si le altre sei: De lequale una ua ala dextra parte del
stomaco a nutrire la tunicha sua exteriore et maxime la parte inferiore:
Laltra uena ua a la milza et e asai grande de laquale nel mezo del [folio 32
verso] suo transito nasce un ramo che descende gioso a nutrire lintriglio
e portali el sangue piu aquoso: Da poi quando questa uena sa proxima a la
milza nasce un altro ramo el quale ua a nutrire la parte sinistra inferiore del
stomaco da poi sucede piu oltra e uasene ala concauita de la milza et iue
se diuide in doi rami cio e inferiore e superiore: linferiore ramo descende
gioso a nutrire el girbo quanto ala parte sua sinistra: el ramo superiore passa
per le concauita de la milza e diuidise in doi altri rami di liquali uno ua a
nutrire la parte superiore sinistra del stomaco, Laltro ua circa la bocha
superiore del stomaco a portarli lhumore melenconicho per incitare lo apetito:
Laltro ramo che rimane ua a la milza anutricarla.</p>

<p>La terza uena di queste sei sene ua al lato stancho e uaseno alo intestino
recto a sucare se qualche humidita uiuatiua fusse rimasta ne le feze.</p>

<p>La quarta uena se ne ua a la superiore parte dritta del stomaco per
nutrirla: La quinta uæna ha doe parte una ua a nutrire la dritta parte del
girbo, laltra parte se ne ua alo intestino colon a sucare quello che e rimasto ne
le feze de humidita et anche a nutrirlo: et impero el girbo molto se congionge
cum lo intestino colon ne la parte dritta: La sexta uena sene ua alo
intestine ieiuno et a lialtri intestini suttili a sucarli e nutrirli.</p>

<p>La figura del figato debba [folio 33 recto] essere lunare in modo de una
luna quando e piu che meza. Questo membro ha quatro uirtu una atratiua
per la quale atrahe el chilo a se: La seconda retentiua per laquale lo
ritiene debito tempo acio che la terza uirtu che e digestiua lo conuerta in
sangue: La quarta uirtu e expulsiua per laquale manda el sangue a tuti
i membri a nutricarli: et cum esso sangue manda anche el spirito nutritiuo

<p>Vediamo la anothomia dele rene. Onde tu uederai che da la uena

gioso a le parte inferiore, e quando questo ramo e indritto de lerene se diuide
in doi altri rami di liquali uno ua al rognone dritto e laltro al rognone stanco

a le uolte acada chel rognone stanco sia disopra al dritto et alhora el rognone
stanco uira essere piu caldo che el dritto: ben che questo sia [folio 35 verso]
rare uolte.</p>

<p>Queste uene deportano la aquosita del sangue che e inutile al nutrimento
del corpo a le rene et consequenter ala uesica: laquale esce poi
fuora per urina: E per che cum questa aquosita e mescolato anche del
sangue impero bisogno fare a la natura che el se colasse ne le rene in modo
chel sangue mescolato cum questa aquosita rimanesse, e laquosita sola
pasasse ala uesica: et impero se tu scindi el rogne ne la parte gibosa per lo
longo per insino ala concauita tu uederai uno panniculo como uno panno
raro per el quale puo passare la aquosita ma el sangue non impero quilli
che hano aperto questo panniculo o uero colatorio orinano sangue. E questo
panniculo si genera da la uena emulgente dicta laquale intrando ne la

urina indrieto ale rene, anzi quanto la uesica e piu piena de urina tanto piu
se chiudeno dicti buchi.</p>

<p>La uesica e composta de doe tuniche quanto al suo fundo ma quanto
al [folio 36 verso] suo collo e composta de carne e musculo. Item e composta
de nerui e de uene e de artharie ad atrahere laquosita dale rene et
consequenter ad expellerla fuora per la uena.</p>

ma se si taglia nel fondo non si puo saldare, per che el collo e musculoso
e carnoso, et el fonde da la uesica e neruoso.</p>

lurina acio che facilmente non esca fuori senza uolunta de lhuomo ma ne le

nascono desopra de le rene, cio e le loro uene da la uena chilis e le lore artharie
da lartharia adorthi. Onde appare per questo che li uasi spermatici ne li
maschii e ne le femine sono decusi da el core e da el figato e questa e la
seconda conuenientia.</p>

<p>Ma etiam sono differenti per che ne le femine questi uasi se terminano a
la matrice [fol. 38 recto] nel luocho exteriore doue sono li loro te testiculo anzi
propriamente parlando non sono ueramente testiculi como ne gli maschii
anzi sono como testiculi de lepore. Onde fuora de la matrice se riuolgono
e se contexeno e le concauita diquella texitura se reimpiseno di certe carne
minute glandose: E sono facti ne le femine acio che generino una certa
humidita saliuale laquale e cagione de la delectatione de cohito ne la femina.</p>

<p>Da poi quisti uasi spermatici penetrano la matrice per insino a la concauita
e li suoi oreficii di quisti uasi ne la concauita de la matrice se chiamano
cotilidoni cio e legamenti per che mediante quilli sta ligata la creatura ala
matrice: e per questi oreficii uene el sangue mestruo ala femina: Et alcuni
di questi uasi peruengono a la bocha de la matrice a portar li la humidita
saliuale gia dicto: Et da queste uene ramificate nascono doe uene da ciascun
lato cio e una che penetra nel panniculo chiamato mirach et ascendeno per
insina che peruengono ale mamille a deportare el sangue a quelle: Et nota
che quanto piu ascendeno tanto piu se acostano a la cute di fuora: et sono
piu manifeste: ma nel mirach sono piu oculte e questo e contrario ne la porcha
o altri animali che hano le mamille nel mirach: Queste uene nascono da la
matrice e se manifestano nel mirach doue sono poste le mamille.</p>

<p>E dapoi queste uene ascende dal [folio 38 verso] profondo del pecto
indrito al pomo granato una certe uena laquale uene ale mamille a cuocere el
sangue che se de conuertire in lacto e non appare senon una uena.</p>

<p>El luocho de la matrice e che le situata ne la concauita del luocho chiamato
alchatim, laquale concauita e circundata da certi spondili dela schina per

collo de la matrice benche la concauita de la matrice sia piu profonda che la

e forti li quali apresso de la matrice sono larghi e grossi et apresso le anche
sono suttili como corne che sono nel capo de glianimali et impero sono
chiamati corni de la matrice.</p>

<p>La figura sua e quadrangulare cum certa rotondita: et ha el collo inferiore
longo et hebbe questa figura acio che meglio se potesseno distinguere le
cellule o uero camerette che sono ne la sua concauita e sono septe tre ne la
parte dritta e tre ne la parte stancha e una ne la sumita o uero mezo e queste
celule sono certe concauita ne la matrice ne lequale el sperma cum el sangue
mestruo se possano continere et coagulare et consequenter alligarsi a li
oreficii de le uene.</p>

<p>La quantita de la matrice fu mediocre secondo la quantita de la uesica,
ma e magiore in una femina che in laltra per che la femina che fa figlioli ha
magiore matrice che la sterile et similiter la femina che e usa al cohito lha
magiore che la uergene et similiter la matrice de la giouene e magiore che
quella de la puta e de la uechia e per altre cagione narrate da medici puo
essere questa diuersita.</p>

<p>La sua sustantia e neruosa e pelliculosa acio che se possa dillatare a continere

dili testiculi e questi sono uenosi e neruosi.</p>

<p>Alcuni altri uasi sono dilatorii liquali portano el sperma preparato ne li
altri uasi dicti a li testiculi e questi se continuano cum li predicti et sono piu
neruosi: e quanto uano piu ascendendo da li testiculi sono tanto piu neruosi
et ascendeno per insino a losso del petenechio: et alhora se profondano
dentro apresso el collo de la uesica e finaliter procedeno al meato de la uirga
nel luocho che e nel bucho de losso del petenechio e per doe meati che sono
iue mandano el sperma fora da li testiculi el quale fu preparato prima negli
altri uasi e mandano quello sperma nel canale de la uirga e poi la uirga el
manda fuori.</p>

cooperti &amp; uelati de uno panniculo chiamato didimo el quale nasce del paniculo
siphach del quale poi noi diremo, e questo didimo se ha uno oreficio chiuso ne
la fine de dicti uasi et in processo se dillata e tanto procede dilatandosi che
infine di quello se dillatta ala quantita de li testiculi et iue fa una bursa la

et anche de li suoi ministri resta a uedere del suo domicilio el quale e comune
a tuti quilli el quale se chiama mirach.</p>

<p>Questo mirach o uero questo domicilio si e composto de cinque parte cio
e cute pinguedine uno certo panniculo carnoso e certi musculi cum le sue
corde et el siphac: de tute queste cinque parte se constituisse uno cooperculo
et una casa ne laquale se contengono li membri predicti.</p>

<p>E questo tale domicilio fu posto di sotto da li altri per la ignobilita di
membri che se contengono in esso: Onde contiene alcuni membri deputati
a purgare le feçe e le superfluita lequale essende graue descendeno a le parte
inferiore.</p>

<p>Questo domicilio non potette essere ossuoso ma fu carnoso et pelliculoso
acio che secondo li bisogni se potesse dillatare et intumescere como ne la
femina pregnante o uero in colui che ha pigliato troppo cibo o uero ne lo
ydropico o per qualche altra cagione bisognasse infiare el uentre, sel fusse
ossuoso non se potria fare questo.</p>

<p>[folio 42 recto] La prima parte di questo mirach si e la cute de fuora
circa laquale sono da considerare piu luochi: Uno si e corespondente ala
bocha del stomaco che una cartiligine che copre quello e chiamasi pomo

impero ne le parte interiore de lombelico appare una certa uena che se continua
cum esso, et passa per el gibo del figato e per questa uena se porta el
sangue da le uene de la matrice al figato de la creatura et inquesto modo se
nutrisse nel uentre de la matre: Ma questa uena quando lhuomo e nato se
priua di sangue per che mancha la sua operatione quale facea alhora: Et
impero continuamente se ua diminuendo quella uena, onde ne li uechii appare
molte minore che ne li gioueni: Et similiter cum questa uena descende una
certa artharia a lombelico de la creatura laquale quando e ne lombelico
descende gioso e uasene a lartharia adorthi apresso li spondili de le rene
et di li fianchi e questa artharia simelmente se ua deleguando e continue
appare minore como e stato dicto de la predicta uena. E questa artharia tu
uederai exscarnando apresso lombelico et apparerati in forma de uno neruo
o de una corda [folio 42 verso]. El quarto luocho se chiama sumen, di sotto da
lo imbilico quatro dita et e una parte ne laquale se terminano alcune uene
ala cute per le quale la creatura nel uentre de la matre manda fuora le sue
aquosita: e queste uene e questa tale parte si e piu manifesta ne li puti che
non sono nati che ne li perfecti perche essendo queste uene frustrate da la

<p>El quinto luocho si e el petenechio doue sono li membri genitali.</p>

<p>Da poi anche tu hai a considerare le parte laterale cioe li li fianchi e

<p>Dapoi la cute apparerati incontinenti la pinguedine la quale e molto piu
grande nel porcho che ne lhuomo.</p>

<p>Dapoi et tertio te apparera uno panniculo el quale e composto de carne
e nerui.</p>

<p>Quarto di sotto a questo panniculo li sono etiam octo musculi di liquali doi
sono longitudinali che protendeno per el longo dal clipeo de la bocha del stomaco
insino a lossa del petenechio, e quisti musculi non hano gran corde senon
ligamentale, Quatro altri sono transuersali dui superiori e dui inferiori:
Li superiori nascono da le parte di sopra a presso le coste et terminano a certe
corde circa le ossa del petenechio inquesto modo che la corda [folio 43 recto]
dritta ua alingioso al musculo che uiene da la parte sinistra, et la corda
stancha ua gioso al musculo che uiene da la parte dritta: Onde le corde se
incrociano ne la parte inferiore. Li altri dui musculi transuersali sono inferiori
per che comentiano da le ossa del petenechio et de le anche e se terminano
a certe corde in questo medesimo modo che la corda dritta ua al musculo
sinistro e la sinistra ua al musculo dritto, e le corde se incrociano como e stato
dicto.</p>

<p>Doi altri sono latitudinali cusi dicti per che li fili di liquali se componeno
protendendeno secondo el lato: Et uno di quisti musculi e dal lato dritto
e laltro del lato stancho, e sono piu manifesti et anche la sua origine apresso
de la schina uerso la parte superiore: e quisti musculi latitudinali insieme
cum li longitudinali se intersecano ne li anguli dritti.</p>

<p>La utilita di quisti musculi sie prima acio che deffendeseno li membri
interiori da li nocumenti extrinseci, et anche che li riscaldaseno reuerberando
la loro calidita a le parte dentro. La seconda e acio che aiutino ad expellere
le superfluita dal pecto e le superfluita dele feze et etiam ad expellere la
creatura fuora, e queste sono utilita comune a quisti octo musculi: Ma piu
particularmente parlando Li musculi [folio 43 verso] longitudinali sono facti
primo ad atrahere, secondo ad expellere, onde expelleno contrahendo li suoi
uili liquali contratti comprimeno glintestini uerso el diafragma como se
fosseno tra doe mane che li comprimeseno e per questo modo expelleno fuora
le feze: Et per che glintestini hano bisogno maxime di queste doe operatione
cio e de atrahere et expellere impero quisti musculi furno grandi.</p>

<p>Ma li musculi latitudinali sono solo facti ad expellere: &amp; impero sono
piu apresso glintestini et fano questa expulsione comprimendo la parte da
laquale deno expellere: Et per che la expulsione se fa da suso ingioso impero
furno locati piu tosto ne le parte superiore che inferiore.</p>

<p>Li transuersali furno facti a retinere e questo fano mediante li suoi uili
transuersali, E questo bisogno fare la natura acio che le superfluita gio
descese non reascendeseno impero fece li dui transuersali superiori et anche
hebbe intentione che le feçe non descendeseno molto ueloce mente anzi se
retignisseno tanto che el figato le potesse bene esuccarle como e stato dicto
impero fece altri du imusculi transuersali inferiori: liquali sono minori che li
superiori per che magiore fu intentione de la natura a fare che le feze non
reascendeseno cha che uelocemente non descendeseno.</p>

<p>La quinta parte de questo mirach [folio 44 recto] si e uno panniculo
suttilissimo e molto duro chiamato siphac et fu facto acio chel prohibisse che
li musculi dicti non comprimeseno i membri naturali e per questo fu neruoso
acio che se possa dillatere e constringere quando quilli membri se dillateno
e se constringeno. E fu sutile acio che quello non li agrauasse. Et fu duro acio
che facilmente el non se rompesse per che quando se rompe accade quella
passione che si chiama crepatura.</p>

<p>E fu facto etiam questo panniculo acio che el lighe glintestini a la schina
et acio che tuti li panniculi de li altri membri interiori che se contengono<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
in esso habiano origine da quello: Et etiam acio chel prohibisca che glintestini

congionti acio che non si dislacaseno, et anche che non receuesseno

de li altri pur hano el bucho magiore per che la nucha e piu grossa nel collo
che in alcuna pare di li altri spondili e questo fu per che iue ha la sua origine.</p>

<p>Dapoi quisti septe spondili li sono altri spondili che se chiamano spondili
de le coste e sono dodece secondo el numero de le coste de lequale septe

schina a la cauda e sono tri minori di li predicti per che se doueano congiongere

<p>Ultimo sono li spondili de la cauda et quiui sono molte differentie de
buchi per liquali passano li nerui, e queste tale diuersitade se uedeno meglio
nel corpo cotto o uero perfectamente esiccato.</p>

<p>Et in ciascuno spondile e posta la nucha la quale e una medula simile

<h2 class="mt2em">THE BLESSING OF CRAMP-RINGS</h2>

<p class="tac fs120">A CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE TREATMENT
OF EPILEPSY</p>

<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">by Raymond Crawfurd</span></p>


<p>The origin of this ceremony of blessing rings, by the kings
and queens of England, for the cure of epilepsy and other spasmodic
disorders, appears to be well attested by the evidence of
many contemporary records. All alike refer it back to Edward
the Confessor, or, to be more exact, to the ring which was one of
the sacred relics in the shrine of the Confessor in his abbey of
Westminster. Caxton, in the <i>Golden Legend</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span> tells the tale of this
wonderful ring, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘When the blessed King Edward had lived many years, and
was fallen into great age, it happened he came riding by a church
in Essex called Havering, which was at that time in hallowing,
and should be dedicated in the honour of our Lord and S. John
the Evangelist; wherefore the king for great devotion lighted
down and tarried, while the church was in hallowing. And in the
time of procession, a fair old man came to the king and demanded
of him alms in the worship of God and S. John the Evangelist.
Then the king found nothing ready to give, ne his almoner was
not present, but he took off the ring from his finger and gave it
to the poor man, whom the poor man thanked and departed.
And within certain years after, two pilgrims of England went
into the holy land to visit holy places there, and as they had lost
their way and were gone from their fellowship, and the night
approached, and they sorrowed greatly as they that wist not
whither to go, and dreaded sore to be perished among wild beasts;
at the last they saw a fair company of men arrayed in white
clothing, with two lights borne afore them, and behind them there
came a fair ancient man with white hair for age. Then these
pilgrims thought to follow the light and drew nigh. Then the
old man asked them what they were, and of what region, and
they answered that they were pilgrims of England, and had lost
their fellowship and way also. Then this old man comforted
them goodly, and brought them into a fair city where was a fair
<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>cenacle honestly arrayed with all manner of dainties, and when
they had well refreshed them and rested there all night, on the
morn this fair old man went with them, and brought them in the
right way again. And he was glad to hear them talk of the welfare
and holiness of their king S. Edward. And when he should
depart from them, then he told them what he was and said:
I am John the Evangelist, and say ye unto Edward your king
that I greet him right well, by the token that he gave to me this
ring with his own hands at the hallowing of my church, which
ring ye shall deliver to him again. And say ye to him that he
dispose his goods, for within six months he shall be in the joy of
heaven with me, where he shall have his reward for his chastity
and for his good living<span class="ell">...</span>. And when he had delivered to them
the ring he departed from them suddenly. And soon after they
came home and did their message to the king, and delivered to
him the ring, and said that S. John the Evangelist sent it to him.’</p></div>

<p>Shortly after this Edward departed this life, and was laid in
his abbey of Westminster, where the usual abundant harvest of
miraculous cures was enacted at his shrine. In the above story
we have also the explanation of one synonym of epilepsy, the
‘morbus sancti Iohannis’.</p>

<p>The further history of the ring may be gleaned from several
sources, but notably from a MS. by one Richard Sporley, a monk
of the abbey, entitled, ‘De fundacione ecclesie Westm’, dated
<span class="lowercase smcap">A.D</span>. 1450, and now in the British <span class="nowrap">Museum.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span></p>

<p>St. Edward’s ring was deposited with his corpse in the tomb
in <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1066. He was translated at midnight of October 13, 1163,
when his body was found to be incorrupt. Abbot Lawrence took
the robes from the body and made them into three copes, and
gave the ring as a sacred relic to the Abbey:</p>

sight, kneeling at the shrine, while a priest reads the <i>Te Deum</i>.
At the sides of the shrine are figures on pillars of St. John as the
palmer (left), and St. Edward with his ring (right). No cure of
epilepsy, so-called cramp, is depicted among the many miraculous
cures recorded in the MS. The earliest extant records of the
use of the ring for this purpose date from the reign of Edward II.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Anstis<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span> cites the following entry from the last chapter of the
<i>Constitutions of the Household of Edward II</i>: ‘Item le Roi doit
offrer de certein le jour de grant vendredi a crouce. v <i>s.</i> queux
il est acustumez receivre devers lui a la mene le chapelein afair
ent anulx a donner pur medicine az divers gentz’: the language,
however, of the entry leaves little room to doubt that the custom
was already an established one. At his coronation, too, Edward II
offered a pound of gold wrought into a figure representing St.
Edward holding a ring, and a mark of gold, or eight ounces, worked
into the figure of a pilgrim putting forth his hand to receive the
ring: and the presumption is that this gold was to be converted
into cramp-​rings.</p>

<p>We have detailed accounts of the manner of this ceremony
of hallowing cramp-​rings dating from early Tudor times, and
there is sufficient evidence in the brief notices of earlier date to
show that the ceremonial observed by the Plantagenet kings was
essentially similar. On Good Friday, when the king went to
adore the cross, he used to make an offering of money, which
was redeemed by a sum of equivalent value: the money so
received was converted into rings, which were subsequently
hallowed by the king. In Tudor times the hallowing of the rings
took place on Good Friday, so that the offering of the money
must have been made at some previous time, or this part of the
ritual may have actually become obsolete. The change of custom
was effected some time between 9 Edward IV (1470–1) and 13
Henry VIII (1521–2), and was probably therefore the work of
Henry VII, who, as we know, materially altered the kindred
ceremonial of Touching for the Evil.</p>

Rings, and Offeringe and Creepinge to the Crosse’. It is quoted<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘First the king to come to the closett or to the chappell with
the lords and noblemen wayting on him, without any sword to bee
borne before him on that day, and there to tarry in his travers till
the bishop and deane have brought forth the crucifix out of the
vestry (the almoner reading the service of the cramp rings) layd
upon a cushion before the high altar, and then the huishers shall
lay a carpet before y<sup>t</sup> for ye king to creepe to the crosse upon: and
y<sup>t</sup> done, there shall be a fourme set upon the carpet before the
crucifix, and a cushion layd before it for the king to kneele on;
and the Master of the jewell house shal be ther ready with the
crampe rings in a basin or basins of silver: the king shall kneele
upon the sayd cushion before the fourme, and then must the clerke
of the closett bee ready with the booke conteyninge ye service of
the hallowing of the said rings, and the almoner must kneel upon
the right hand of the king, holding of the sayd booke, and when
y<sup>t</sup> is done the king shall rise and go to the high altar, where an
huisher must be ready with a cushion to lay for his grace to kneele
upon, and the greatest Lord or Lords being then present shall take
the basin or basins with the rings and bear them after the king, and
then deliver them to the king to offer; and this done the queen
shall come down out of her closett or travers into the chappell with
ladies and gentlewomen wayters on her, and creepe to the crosse;
and that done she shall returne againe into her closett or travers,
and then the ladies shall come downe and creepe to the crosse, and
when they have done, the Lords and noblemen shall in likewise.’</p></div>

<p>Creeping to the Cross seems to have been practised in noble
households as well as in that of the king. The following entry is
found in the Northumberland Household <span class="nowrap">Book<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span> (<i>temp.</i> Henry VIII):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Item my Lord useth and accustometh yerely when his Lordship
is at home to cause to be delyveride for the Offerings of my
Lordis Sone and Heire the Lord Percy upon the said Good Friday

Maisters my Lords Yonger Sonnes after j<i>d</i>. to every of them for
their Offerings when they Crepe the Cross the said Good Friday
iiij<i>d</i>.’</p></div>

<p>Many of the entries in the accounts of the Plantagenet kings
show that the homage was paid to the Gneyth Cross. This cross
was held in great veneration, and, according to tradition, was made
of wood from the true Cross presented by a pilgrim to Richard
Cœur de Lion: no satisfactory explanation of its name is forth<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>coming.
It seems to have been transferred from place to place.
Under Edward I we find it in the royal chapel of the Priory of
Plympton: under Edward II in the royal chapel within the Tower:
under Edward III in the private chapel of the royal Manor of Clipstone,
and later in the same reign in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor,
where it was in the time of Henry VII. The purpose of the ceremony
is set forth in a Proclamation of February 26, 30 Henry VIII,
now in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries: ‘On Good
Friday it shall be declared howe creepyng of the Crosse signifyeth
an humblynge of ourselfe to Christe before the Crosse, and the
kyssynge of it a memorie of our redemption made upon the Crosse.’
When Convocation, in <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1536, abolished some of the old ceremonies,
on the ground that they were superstitious, this of Creeping
to the Cross was retained as a laudable and edifying custom.</p>

<p>The following records, taken from the Household Books and
Account Rolls of the times, serve to establish the continuity
of the ceremonial subsequent to its first mention in the time of
Edward II.</p>

<p>In the Eleemosyna Roll of 9 Edward <span class="nowrap">III<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></span> occurs the following
entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In oblacione domini Regis ad crucem de Gneythe die parasceues
in capella sua, infra mannerium suum de Clipstone, in
precium duorum florencium de Florencia, xiiii die Aprilis, vi<i>s.</i>

pence bestowed in redemption of the said florins for the making of
medicinal rings, on the same day, vi<i>s.</i>: total xii<i>s.</i> viii<i>d.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Again, in the Eleemosyna Roll of the following year, 10 Edward
<span class="nowrap">III:<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In oblacione domini Regis ad crucem de Gneyth in die parasceues

a line was used above a roman numeral to indicate that the numeral
represented one thousand times its ‘face value’. An overline was also

in the book."><span class="ol">xxix</span></ins> die Marcii, v<i>s.</i>, et

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In oblacione domini regis ad crucem de Gneyth in capella sua

reassumptis pro annulis inde faciendis v<i>s.</i>’</p></div>

<p>Here the sum total is omitted: the three entries, though
mutually explanatory, show how puzzling becomes a too strict
economy of words.</p>

<p>Entries substantially the same as these may be seen in the
Wardrobe Accounts of 12–14 Edward <span class="nowrap">III.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span></p>

<p>One more entry from the Account Books of John de Ypres,
44 Edward III, is perhaps worth quoting, as it seems to point
definitely to the rings being made in this instance of both gold and
silver:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In oblacionibus Regis factis adorando crucem in capella sua
infra castrum suum de Wyndesore die parasceues in pretio trium
nobilium auri et quinque solidorum sterling xxv<i>s.</i>&mdash;In denariis
solutis pro iisdem oblacionibus reassumptis pro annulis medicinalibus
inde faciendis, eodem die xxv.’</p></div>

<p>The offering of both gold and silver money would seem to bear
out the suggestion as to the material of the rings, as we know that
in later times both metals were used. It is, of course, arguable
that the larger sum of money indicates only a greater demand for
the rings.</p>

<p>Richard II’s Account <span class="nowrap">Books<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span> show that he maintained the
practice of his grandfather. The following is from an account of
the Controller of the Wardrobe in his reign:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘in denar&#772; solut&#772; decano capelle Regis pro eisdem oblacionibus
reassumpt&#772; pro anulis medicinaƚ inde faciendis, <span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>xxv<i>s.</i>’</p></div>

<p>The substituted money seems to have been actually laid on the
altar, and removed thence to be made into rings: this will explain
payment being made in this case to the Dean of the Chapel Royal.</p>

<p>Henry IV could ill afford to dispense with any of the prerogatives
of royalty, and we find him offering 25 shillings in the chapel
of the palace of Eltham for the making of medicinal <span class="nowrap">rings.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span></p>

<p>It is no matter for surprise that no mention should be forthcoming
of cramp-​rings in the reign of Henry V, most of which was
spent beyond the shores of England, and in the propagation rather
than in the relief of disease. A passage, however, in the literary
remains of Sir John <span class="nowrap">Fortescue<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></span> taken from a tract entitled <i>Defensio
Iuris Domus Lancastriae</i>, now to be seen in the Cotton Collection
at the British Museum, and referable to the year <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1462, seems
to show that the practice had not been allowed to lapse during his
memory, which ranged over the reigns of Henry IV, V, and VI.
The translated passage runs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Many duties likewise are incumbent on the Kings of England
in virtue of the kingly office, which are inconsistent with a woman’s
nature, and Kings of England are endowed with certain powers
by special grace from heaven, wherewith Queens in the same
country are not endowed. The Kings of England at their very
anointing receive such an infusion of grace from heaven, that by
touch of their anointed hands they cleanse and cure those infected
with a certain disease, that is commonly called the King’s Evil,
though they be pronounced otherwise incurable. Epileptics too,
and persons subject to the falling sickness, are cured by means of
gold and silver devoutly touched and offered by the sacred anointed
hands of the kings of England upon Good Friday, during divine
service (according to the ancient custom of the Kings of England);
as has been proved by frequent trial of rings, made of the said gold
and silver and placed on the fingers of sick persons in many parts
of the world. The gift is not bestowed on Queens, as they are not
anointed on the hands.’</p></div>

<p>The passage also brings out the fact that the use of both gold
and silver rings had long been customary.</p>

<p>We have abundant evidence of the maintenance of the ceremony
under Edward IV in a number of separate entries. Thus in
an Eleemosyna Roll of 8 Edward IV is the following: ‘Pro eleemosyna
in die parasceves c. marc. et pro annulis de auro et argento pro
eleemosyna Regis eodem die.’ And in a Liber Niger Domus Regis
Edwardi IV: ‘Item, to the Kynge’s offerings to the crosse on Good
Friday, out from the counting-​house for medycinable rings of gold
and silver, delyvered to the jewell house xxv<i>s.</i>’ And again in
a Privy Seal Account of 9 Edward IV: ‘Item, paid for the King’s
Good Fryday rings of gold and silver xxxiii<i>l.</i> vi<i>s.</i> viii<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span><i>d.</i>’ Edward
IV seems to have aimed at fortifying himself upon the throne by
a liberal use of the Royal Gift of Healing, and I have elsewhere
expressed my belief, in the absence of any written evidence, that
it was in his reign, and not in that of Henry VII, as commonly
believed, that the dole of the angel to those touched by the King
for the Evil was instituted. Cramp-​rings are mentioned in the
Comptroller’s Accounts of 20 Henry VII, but the Tudors certainly
devoted their healing powers chiefly to sufferers from the Evil.</p>

<p>There is a passage in the <i>Historia Anglicana</i> of Polydore <span class="nowrap">Vergil,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span>
the Italian, who came to live in England in <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1502, and wrote
his history during the reigns of Henry VII and VIII, which shows
the nature of the patients for whom these sacred rings were used.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Iste annulus in eodem templo (scil. Westmonasterii), multâ
veneratione perdiu est servatus, quod salutaris esset membris
stupentibus valeretque adversus comitialem morbum, cum tangeretur
ab illis, qui eiusmodi tentarentur morbis. Hinc natum,
ut reges postea Angliae consueverint in die Parasceues, multâ
coeremoniâ sacrare annulos, quos qui induunt, hisce in morbis
omnino nunquam sunt.’</p></div>

<p>Besides true epileptics, they were used for those who had palsied
limbs: this is interesting as suggesting the inclusion of Jacksonian
epilepsy, and perhaps hemiplegia, and the resulting contractures
in these conditions may have contributed to the confusion with
contractures from other causes, such as chronic rheumatism. We
have to bridge over in some such way the gap between their conception
of ‘cramp’ and ours.</p>

<p>In the will of John Baret of Bury St. <span class="nowrap">Edmunds,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span> dated 1463,
is a bequest to ‘my lady Walgrave’ of a ‘rowund ryng of the
Kynges silver’; and also to ‘Thomais Brews, esquiyer, my crampe
ryng with blak innamel, and a part silvir and gilt.’ And in 1535
Edmund Lee bequeaths to ‘my nece Thwartow my gold ryng w<sup>t</sup>
a turkes, and a crampe ryng of gold w<sup>t</sup> all.’</p>

<p>There are even earlier bequests than this of <span class="nowrap">healing-rings,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span> but
not specifically termed cramp-​rings: they are simply spoken of as
‘vertuosi’. Thus Thomas de Hoton, rector of Kyrkebymisperton,
in 1351, bequeathed to his chaplain ‘j. zonam de serico,
j. bonam bursam, j. firmaculum, et j. anulum vertuosum. Item,
domino Thome de Bouthum j. par de bedes de corall, j. anulum
vertuosum.’ Talismanic rings, inscribed with the names of the
three Magi, Caspar, Melchior, Balthazar, were used as preservatives
from epilepsy in Plantagenet times.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span></p>
<p>The royal cramp-​rings enjoyed no monopoly in the cure of
epilepsy, as is shown by an extract from a medical treatise written
in the fourteenth <span class="nowrap">century:<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘For the Crampe. Tak and ger gedine on Gude Friday, at

<p>The ‘fife wondes’ are, of course, the five wounds of the crucified
Jesus.</p>

<p>A silver ring, made of five sixpences contributed by five different
bachelors, conveyed by a bachelor to the hand of a smith that was
also a bachelor, was another reputed remedy for epilepsy; and
its virtue was enhanced, if none of the bachelors knew for what
purpose or to whom it was <span class="nowrap">given.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></span></p>

<p>In Berkshire, rings made from a piece of silver collected at
the Communion found favour, and they were more efficacious
if collected on Easter Sunday. Devonshire preferred a ring made
of three nails or screws that had been used to fasten a coffin, and
that had been dug out of a <span class="nowrap">churchyard.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span></p>

<p>Cramp-rings hallowed by the King of England enjoyed repute
beyond the shores of <span class="nowrap">England.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span> Lord Berners, the translator of
Froissart, when ambassador to Charles V, writing to ‘my Lorde
Cardinall’s grace from Saragoza, the xxi daie of June, 1510’, says:
‘If your grace remember me with some crampe rynges ye shall do
a thynge muche looked for, and I trust to bestow thaym well, with
Godd’s grace, who evermor preserve and encrease your moste
reverent astate.’ Among various charms that Charles V carried
about with him were ‘gold rings from England against <span class="nowrap">cramp’.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span></p>

<p>In <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1518 we find the President of the College of Physicians
lending his patronage to the royal cramp-​rings. In a letter to
the Parisian scholar, Guillaume <span class="nowrap">Budé,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></span> Thomas Linacre writes<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
that he ‘has sent him some rings consecrated by the King as a
charm against Spasms’: and on July 10, 1518, Budé replies to
him from Paris that he has ‘received his letter with the rings on
July 6’, and has distributed among the wives of his relatives
and friends the eighteen rings of silver and one of gold he received
from Linacre, telling them that they were amulets against slander
and calumny.</p>

<p>Even the hard-headed Scot was not proof against the magnetism
of the royal rings. A letter from Dr. Thomas Magnus, Warden
of Sibthorpe College, Nottinghamshire, to Cardinal <span class="nowrap">Wolsey,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></span>

<p>When Bishop Gardiner was in Rome in <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1529, Anne Boleyn

<p>Master Stephyns,</p>

<p>I thank you for my letter, wherein I perceive the willing and
faithful mind that you have to do me pleasure, not doubting, but
as much as is possible for man’s wit to imagine, you will do. I pray
God to send you well to speed in all your matters, so that you would
put me to the study, how to reward your high service: I do trust in
God you shall not repent it, and that the end of this journey shall be
more pleasant to me than your first, for that was but a rejoicing
hope, which causing the like of it, does put me to the more pain, and
they that are partakers with me, as you do know: and therefore
I do trust that this hard beginning shall make the better ending.</p>

<p>Master Stephyns, I send you here cramp-rings for you and
Master Gregory, and Mr. Peter, praying you to distribute them as
you think best. And have me kindly recommended to them both,<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
as she that you may assure them, will be glad to do them any
pleasure, which shall be in my power. And thus I make an end,
praying God send you good health.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘When he [Gardiner] went to Rome, in the year 1529, Anne
Boleyn writ a very kind letter to him, which I have put in the
Collection (Records No. 24). By it, the reader will clearly perceive
that he was then in the secret of the King’s designing to marry her
as soon as the divorce was obtained. There is another particular
in that letter, which corrects a conjecture which I had set down in
the beginning of the former book concerning the cramp rings that
were blessed by King Henry, which I thought might have been done
by him after he was declared head of the <span class="nowrap">Church.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></span> That part was
printed before I saw this letter: but this letter shows they were
used to be blessed before the separation from Rome: for Anne
Boleyn sent them as great presents thither. This use of them had
been (it seems) discontinued in King Edward’s time: but now,
under Queen Mary, it was designed to be revived, and the office for
it was written out in a fair MS. yet extant, of which I have put a
copy in the Collection (No. 25). But the silence in the writers of
that time makes me think it was seldom if ever practised.’</p></div>

<p>Queen Mary’s Manual, of which we shall have more to say later,
seems to have been the source from which Burnet transcribed the
Office. In his time it was in the library of R. Smith, titular Bishop
of Chalcedon.</p>

<p>Numerous allusions in the records of the De Lisle family bear
testimony to the popularity of cramp-​rings in the reign of
Henry <span class="nowrap">VIII.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span> Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford and afterwards
Duke of Somerset, writes to Lady Lisle, in 1537:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Hussey told me you were very desirous to have some cramp-rings
against the time that you should be brought a bedd<span class="ell">...</span>. I
send by the present messenger 18 cramp-​rings, which you should
have had long <span class="nowrap">ago.’<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span></p></div>

<p>John Husee writes from London on April 17, 1535, to his mistress,
Lady Lisle: ‘I send you by Mr. Degory Gramefilld 59 cramp rings
<span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>of silver, that Christofer Morys giveth you, and one of <span class="nowrap">gold’;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></span> and
again, on May 2, 1538: ‘Cramp-​rings I can get none out of the
jewel-​house. Mr. Wyll<sup>m</sup>s says the King had the most part of gold,
but has promised me twelve <span class="nowrap">silver.’<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></span></p>

<p>In a letter of May 13, 1536, John Husee combines denunciation
of Anne Boleyn with a promise of cramp-​rings to Lady Lisle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Madam, I think verily that if all the books and cronycles were
totally revolved and to the uttermost proscuted and tried, which
against wymen hath been pennyd, contryvyd, and wryten, syns
Adam and Eve, these same were I think verily nothing in comparison
with that which hath been done and committed by Anne the
Queen<span class="ell">...</span>. I think not the contrary but she and all they shall
suffre. John Williams hath promised me some cramp rings for
your <span class="nowrap">Ladyship’;<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span></p></div>

<p>and again, six days after:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Your ladyship shall receive of this berer 9 cramp-rings of
silver. John Williams says he never had so few of gold as this
year. The king had the most part himself: but next year he will
make you <span class="nowrap">amends.’<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></span></p></div>

<p>This day, May 19, 1536, was the day of Anne Boleyn’s execution.</p>

<p>Margaret Mylynton, in 1516, bequeaths to ‘my dame Croche
my best gown and a kercheve, and my <span class="nowrap">cramp-ring’.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></span> There
is nothing, however, to show that it had received the royal
benediction.</p>

<p>Andrew Boorde, in his <i>Introduction of Knowledge</i>, says, ‘the
kynges of Englande doth halowe every yere crampe rynges, ye
which rynges worne on ones fynger doth help them whych hath
the crampe’; and again, in his <i>Breviarie of Health</i>, published in
1547, but written during the lifetime of Henry VIII: ‘The kynges
majesty hath a great helpe in this matter, in hallowing crampe
rynges, and so given without money or petition.’ Boorde was
medical attendant to Thomas, eighth Duke of Norfolk, Lord President
of the Council and uncle of Anne Boleyn, and by him was
recommended to the notice of Henry VIII, who employed him
much in State business, but not, so far as is known, in a medical
capacity. His testimony therefore is peculiarly reliable, and shows<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
that Henry VIII maintained the ceremony throughout his reign,
as is borne out by the scattered references we have adduced from
other contemporary sources.</p>

<p>In 1547, after the death of Henry VIII, Gardiner sent a letter
to Ridley, which contains the following passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The late king used to bless cramp rings both of gold and
silver, which were much esteemed everywhere, and when he was
abroad they were often desired from him. The gift he hoped the
young king would not neglect. He believed the invocation of the
name of God might give such a virtue to holy water as well as to
the water of baptism,’ and further he speaks of the rings as endued
‘by the special gift of curation ministered to the king of this
<span class="nowrap">realm’.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></span></p></div>

<p>That Edward VI did not relinquish the practice of blessing
cramp-​rings, as has been supposed, and as Burnet submits, is conclusively
proved by an entry in the Household Accounts of the
year 1553, before his death. Under the heading ‘Oblations’ is
25 shillings for the redemption of rings commonly called medicine
rings, to be made of gold and <span class="nowrap">silver.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></span></p>

<p>It was little likely that Mary would allow a Catholic ceremonial
to lapse for want of royal patronage. In the Appendix to <i>Illustrations
of the manners and expences of antient times in England,
in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries, deduced from the accompts
of churchwardens and other authentic documents, London, 1797,
4to</i>, printed in the same year, is a list of the New Year’s gifts
presented by Queen Mary in 1556, among which we find:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Item, deliuerid by the queins commandement&mdash;to the said
Robert Raynes, in broken golde, to make crampe rings, etc. Item,
more deliuerid the same time, to make cramp ringes, in broke plate
of silu’ theise parcelles,’ &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>But there is further the evidence of the actual existence of
Queen Mary’s Illuminated MS. Manual, in the Library of the
Roman Catholic Cathedral of Westminster, giving the Office of the
Blessing of Cramp-​rings in Latin, with rubrics in English showing it
to be the form made use of by herself. It also contains a miniature
painting of Queen Mary performing the service of consecration.
The whole office is transcribed below. A full description of the
Manual will be found in the <span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span><i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></span>
at a meeting of whom it was shown and described by
Sir Henry Ellis. Sparrow Simpson has also described it in the
<i>Journal of the Archaeological Association</i>, 1871. It is a ‘small
quarto volume, eight and a half inches in height by six and three-​eighths
in width’. Cardinal Wiseman, to whom it formerly
belonged, has written on the fly-leaf, ‘Queen Mary’s manual for
blessing cramp-​rings and touching for the Evil. Bound 1850.’
The cover is spangled with roses and fleurs-de-lis, together with
the Queen’s monogram MR. ‘The volume consists of nineteen
leaves of vellum, each surrounded with a rich border, and filled
either with miniatures or with the two offices which it comprises.
Then follow four ruled leaves and fifteen plain leaves without
manuscript<span class="ell">...</span>. On the recto of leaf 1 the royal arms of Philip
and Mary are emblazoned, surrounded by a garter and surmounted
by a crown. A rich border containing the rose, the fleur-de-lis,
and the pomegranate, together with a shield bearing the cross of
St. George, completes the decorations of the page.’ The red and
white roses represent Queen Mary’s double title to the throne of
England as the heiress of the houses of Lancaster and York, the
fleur-de-lis her claim to the throne of France, and the pomegranate
of Granada her descent from Ferdinand and Isabella. The Cross
of St. George is derived from the shield of the Order of the Garter.
‘On the verso of this leaf is an illumination (Plate <span class="lowercase smcap"><a href="#XL">XL</a></span>) representing
the interior of a chapel with an altar furnished with curtains, candlesticks,
and crucifix. At a prayer-​desk before the altar kneels the
Queen; before her is an open book, and on either side two golden
basins containing cramp-​rings.’ Leaves 2 to 10 contain ‘certayn
prayo’s to be vsed by the quenes heighnes in the consecration of
the crampe ryngs’. A study of the rubrics, which are in English,
suffices ‘to show the essentials for the consecration of the rings:
the prayers, the royal touch, the holy water<span class="ell">...</span>. The recto of
leaf 11 is filled with an illumination of the Crucifixion with St. Mary
and St. John. In the border are the instruments of the Passion&mdash;the
spear, the reed and sponge, the hammer and pincers, three nails,
two scourges, and (a very unusual addition) a centre-​bit of the same
form as that now in use. On the verso of this leaf is a very interesting
full-​page illumination. At a prayer-​desk, on which is an open
book, kneels the Queen, turning to the right (the dexter side of the
picture), wearing the head-dress familiar to us in all her portraits.
<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>Before her kneels a sufferer, apparently a young man, whose bare
and swollen neck the Queen holds between her two hands. Behind
him, holding open the collar of the patient’s coat, kneels the
“clarke of the closett” in a cassock and gown, and with a tonsured
head. On the left of the prayer-​desk stands “the chaplen”, a bald-​headed,
venerable man in a long cassock, a somewhat short surplice
with full sleeves, and the “stole abowte his neck” ordered in the
rubric, reading the appointed office. The Queen wears a brown
dress cut square at the neck, white sleeves, and a lace ruff and waist-​bands.
The office for the healing follows, commencing on folio <i>12a</i>,
and ending on folio <i>19a</i>.</p>

<p>‘The rubrics are in red ink, bright and fresh; and each page has
a rich border of scrolls, leaves, flowers, and fruit, with occasional
figures of children, &amp;c. I enumerate the most important subjects.
Folio <i>1b</i>, David with head of Goliath, St. George and the Dragon,
and a child with a skull; folio <i>2b</i>, arms of the city of London;
folio <i>3a</i>, <span class="lowercase smcap">VERITAS TEMPORIS FILIA</span> (the Queen’s favourite motto),

<p>With the death of Mary, the ceremonial seems finally to have
fallen into disuse. There is, however, a passage in the <i>Historia
Anglicana Ecclesiastica</i> of Nicholas <span class="nowrap">Harpsfield,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></span> which was written
entirely in the reign of Elizabeth, which seems to throw some doubt
on the point. The words are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Quin et annulus ille, de quo diximus, magna in Westmonasteriensi
Londini coenobio postea reverentia reservatus, adversus
comitialem morbum multis profuit: indeque etiam ortum, ut ad
sacram parasceuen Reges Angliae certos annulos statis quibusdam
precibus et caerimoniis consecrare consueverint, adversus eundem
morbum salutares. Quae consuetudo et ad nostra usque tempora
perducta est, multique huiusmodi annulorum beneficium, nostra
etiam aetate, senserunt.’ [And further the above-​mentioned ring
was reverently preserved afterwards in the monastery of Westminster
in London, and relieved many of epilepsy. That too was
the origin of the custom of the Kings of England on Good Friday
consecrating certain rings with set prayers and ceremonies, for the<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
cure of the same disease. Which custom has persisted even down
to our own times, and many even in our own lifetimes have derived
benefit from rings of this kind.]</p></div>

<p>Nicholas Harpsfield, though he did not write till the reign of
Elizabeth, was born as early as <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1519, so that his words are
consistent with discontinuance of the ceremony after the time of
Queen Mary.</p>

<p>It remains to consider what diseased states were embraced by
the term ‘cramp’. Epilepsy, convulsions, and rheumatism certainly.
All these terms have in common the idea of muscular
contraction or spasm, and their relation in usage to one another
may be represented graphically as under:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 265px;">
<img src="images/cramp.jpg" width="265" height="41" alt="Diagram showing which disease states were embraced by the term ‘cramp’" />
</div>

<p>Confusion of these terms is far more marked in medical than in
lay writers; but at the same time there is little doubt that the
conservative sentiment inspired by the royal ceremonial kept the
term ‘cramp’ alive in a sense that was all but obsolete in the
common diction.</p>

<p>Chaucer applies ‘crampe’ to muscular spasm:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But wel he felte about his herte crepe <span class="ell">..</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crampe of death, to streyne him by the <span class="nowrap">herte.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Linacre, as we have seen, speaks of cramp-rings, in 1518, as
a charm against <i>spasms</i>, while about the same year Polydore Vergil
speaks of the royal cramp-​rings as a cure for the <i>morbus comitialis</i>.
Each of these two writers clearly indicates epilepsy. In 1526
Magnus speaks definitely of cramp-​rings as relieving a man lying in
the <i>falling-​sickness</i>, a term habitually applied to epilepsy. Nicholas
Harpsfield too, writing in the middle of the reign of Elizabeth,
speaks of cramp-​rings blessed by the kings as remedies for the
<i>morbus comitialis</i>. In all probability royal cramp-​rings were used
for epilepsy and epilepsy only, but it is quite possible, and I am
inclined to think probable, that other cramp-​rings had a less
exclusive use.</p>

<p>Bacon’s description of cramp in his <i>Natural and Experimental
History</i> is fairly explicit and obviously does not embrace epilepsy:
‘The cramp cometh of contraction of sinews, which is manifest,
in that it comes either by cold or dryness.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="181"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span></p>
<p>Shakespeare recognizes both epilepsy and rheumatism as
entities apart from cramp. Epilepsy he seems to associate more
with falling than with convulsion: thus, of the fit that attacked
Caesar when the crown was offered to him, he writes:</p>

<p><i>Casca.</i> He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
mouth, and was speechless.</p>

<p><i>Brutus.</i> ‘Tis very like: he hath the <span class="nowrap">falling-sickness.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></span></p>

<p>‘Cramp’ is used by Shakespeare for muscular spasms or contractures,
and he links the term on the one side to rheumatism, and
on the other to convulsions, in the following passages:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath <span class="nowrap">up.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Parolles says:</p>

<p>‘In a retreat he outruns any lackey: marry, in coming on he
has the <span class="nowrap">cramp.’<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></span></p>

<p>Prospero says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Go, charge my goblins that they grind their joints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With aged <span class="nowrap">cramps.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and</p>

<p>‘Leander <span class="ell">..</span>. went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont,
and being taken with the cramp was <span class="nowrap">drowned.’<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></span></p>

<p>Robert Bayford, in his <i>Enchiridion Medicum</i> published in 1655,
includes both wry-​neck and convulsions under the heading cramp,
but he treats epilepsy separately on the ground that, as we know
to be the case, it is not always associated with convulsions. He
has no word ‘rheumatism’ at all.</p>

<p>Pepys (1664) carried about with him a hare’s foot as a charm
against <i>colic</i>, i.e. against muscular spasm. Among Indians,
Norwegians, and Central Africans, the foot of an elk was a charm
against epilepsy. Pepys also recites a charm against cramp:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cramp, be thou faintless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As our Lady was sinless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she bare Jesus.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this charm the word cramp seems to refer to the painful <i>muscular
spasms</i> of labour. Pepys, as we know, suffered from colic, but not<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
from epilepsy, so in using a hare’s foot as a charm against colic he
was probably employing a charm against epilepsy. In like manner
the ‘rheumatic ring’ of to-day seems to be the lineal descendant
of the cramp-​ring of aforetime, and the confusion of nomenclature
has doubtless not affected its efficacy. Folk-​medicine serves
rather to confirm than to elucidate the confusion, for in Suffolk
moles’ feet are carried as a charm against rheumatism, but in
Sussex against cramp. In Devonshire a dried frog is worn as
a cure for fits.</p>

<p>Boswell, in his description of Johnson at the time of their tour
to the Hebrides, uses the word ‘cramp’ in its earlier significance.
‘His head,’ he says, ‘and sometimes also his body, shook with
a kind of motion like the effect of a palsy: he appeared to be
frequently disturbed by cramps, or convulsive contractions, of the
nature of that distemper called St. Vitus’s dance.’</p>

<p>It may be asked how it came about that rings were used in the
first instance as a remedy for epilepsy. It has occurred to me that
their use may have originated in the time-​honoured belief that an
epileptic seizure may be aborted by ligature of a limb or part above
the situation in which the warning ‘aura’ commences. Galen,
Alexander of Tralles, Rhazes, and Avicenna, among the earlier
writers on medicine, all recommend the measure.</p>

<p>That we may know thy ways on earth: among all nations thy salvation.</p>

<p>May people acknowledge thee, O God: may all people acknowledge thee.</p>

<p>Let nations rejoice and be glad, because thou judgest people with equity:

pleased for the comfort of mankind, continually to grant us many and
various means to relieve us in our miseries, and art willing to make those
the instruments and channels of thy gifts, and to grace those persons with
more excellent favours, whom thou hast raised to the royal dignity; to the
end that as by thee they reign and govern others, so by thee they may
prove beneficial to them, and bestow thy favours on the people: graciously
heare our prayers and favourably receive those vows we powre forth with
humility, that thou mayest grant to us, who beg with the same confidence,
the favour which our ancestors by their hopes in thy mercy have obtained,
through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p>He has not dealt with us in proportion to our sins: nor has he rendred
unto us according to our offences.</p>

<p>Because according to the distance of heaven from earth: so has he
enforced his mercies upon those who feare him.</p>

<p>As far distant as the east is from the west: so far has he divided our
offences from us.</p>

<p>After the manner that a father takes pity of his sons; so has the
Lord taken pity of those who feare him: because he knows what we are
made of.</p>

<p>He remembers that we are but dust: man like hey such are his days:

<h2 class="mt2em">DR. JOHN WEYER AND THE WITCH MANIA</h2>

<p class="tac">By <span class="smcap">E.&nbsp;T. Withington</span></p>


<p>The value of every new truth or discovery is relative, and
depends upon the state of ideas or knowledge prevalent at the
time. Should it go greatly
beyond this, it may lose much
in practical effect, like good
seed falling on unprepared soil;
but the discoverer is no less
worthy of praise though he be
so far in advance of his fellows
that they refuse to accept his
teaching, and persecute instead
of honouring him. Posterity,
however, often ignores former
conditions, especially in an era
of rapid progress, for the
quicker the advance the sooner
will the early stages be forgotten,
however important and
difficult they may have been.</p>

<p>Among those who were so
far beyond their age that the
truths they proclaimed not only
were rejected by the majority
but brought them into danger was Dr. John Weyer, the first serious
opponent of the witch mania. He stood almost alone. His attack on
the witch-​hunters, though it marks the turn of the tide, was followed
by more than a century of cruelty, injustice, and superstition; yet
our ideas on the subject are now so entirely altered that it is hard
to imagine the value and danger of the service he performed, and
his name was almost forgotten even by members of his own profession,
when his biography was published by Dr. K. Binz in <span class="nowrap">1885.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span></p>
<p>Let us try to get some idea of the nature of the witch mania,
that we may better appreciate the courage and intelligence of this
ancient physician.</p>

<p>In the second half of the fifteenth century a new age began in
Western Europe. The revival of Greek, the invention of printing,
and the discovery of America gave fresh ideas and new prospects
to mankind. But, as the sun’s rays were believed to breed serpents
in fermenting matter, so amid this ferment of new life and
light rose a hideous monster, more terrible than any fabled dragon
of romance or superstition of the darkest ages, which for generations
satiated itself on the tears and blood of the innocent and
helpless. This was the witch mania. For two centuries the
majority of theologians and jurists in Western Europe were convinced
that vast numbers of their fellow creatures, especially
women, were in league with the devil, that they had sexual intercourse
with him or his imps, and that he bestowed on them in
exchange for their souls the power of injuring their neighbours in
person or property. They thought it their duty to search out these
witches, to force from them, by the most terrible tortures they
could devise, not only confessions of their own guilt, but also
denunciations of their associates, and finally to put them to death,
preferably by burning. In consequence, many thousands of
innocent persons of all ages and ranks, but especially poor women,
were judicially murdered, after being first compelled by unspeakable
torments to commit moral suicide by declaring themselves
guilty of unmentionable crimes, and to involve their dearest friends
and relations in a similar fate. There is no sadder scene in the
whole tragicomedy of human history.</p>

<p>There had been nothing like it in the darkest of the dark ages,
there was nothing like it among the far more ignorant and superstitious
adherents of the Eastern Church. The witch mania in its
extreme form has been manifested only by the Catholics and Protestants
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and by some
tribes of African savages.</p>

<p>In early Christian times, witchcraft was recognized as a relic
of paganism, but it was not feared. Christ had overcome the
powers of darkness, and His true followers need fear no harm from
them. A canon of the Church, at least as early as the ninth<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
century, declared that women who thought they rode through the
air with Diana or Herodias were only deluded by the devil, and
that those who believed human beings could create anything, or
change themselves or others into animal forms, were infidels and
worse than heathens; and confessors were instructed to inquire
into and inflict penance for the belief that witches could enter closed
doors, make hail-​storms, or kill persons without visible <span class="nowrap">means.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span></p>

<p>In the enlightened sixteenth century, any one who professed his
disbelief that witches could ride through the air, change themselves
into cats, or make caterpillars and thunder-​storms, would have had
an excellent chance of being burnt as a heretic or concealed sorcerer.
St. Boniface (680–755) classed belief in witches and were-wolves
among the works of the devil, and St. Agobard of Lyons
(779–840) declared the idea that witches caused hail and thunder-​storms
to be impious and <span class="nowrap">absurd.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></span> The laws of Charlemagne made
it murder to put any one to death on charge of witchcraft, and
in the eleventh century King Coloman of Hungary asserted briefly,
‘Let no one speak of witches, seeing there are <span class="nowrap">none’.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></span> Few, indeed,
were quite so sceptical as this; still witchcraft was in the Middle
Ages looked upon by the educated in a half-​contemptuous fashion,
and even those who openly professed sorcery frequently escaped
with no worse punishment than penance, banishment, or an
ecclesiastical scourging.</p>

<p>This may be well illustrated by a story told in the life of the
learned Dominican, St. Vincent of Beauvais. An old woman once
(1190–1264) came to a priest in his church and demanded money
from him, saying she had done him a great service, for that, when
she and her companions, who were witches, had entered his bedroom
the previous night, she had prevented them from injuring
him. ‘But how’, asked the priest, ‘could you enter my chamber,
seeing that the door was locked?’ ‘Oh,’ said the witch, ‘that
matters naught to us, for we go through keyholes as easily as
through open doors.’ ‘If what you say is true,’ replied the holy
man, ‘you shall not lack a reward, but I must first have proof of
it.’ With these words, he locked the church door, and began<span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
vigorously to beat the old woman with the handle of the crucifix
he carried, asking her, when she complained, why she did not
escape through the <span class="nowrap">keyhole.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span></p>

<p>The great Pope Nicholas I (died 867) strongly condemned the
use of torture to induce confessions, and Gregory VII (died 1085)
forbade inquisition to be made for witches and sorcerers on
occasions of plague or bad <span class="nowrap">weather.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></span> Later, the inquisitorial
process, combined with torture to enforce denunciations, became
the chief agent in spreading and maintaining the witch mania.</p>

<p>The Eastern Church remained in this mediaeval stage, and
never developed a witch mania. In the West the change seems
to have been brought about mainly by two causes, the development
of heresies and the increasing prominence of the devil.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Albigensian and other heresies of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries contained Manichean elements.
It was taught that there were two divinities&mdash;one perfectly good,
the creator of the invisible spiritual world, the other the creator of
the material world, the Demiurgus, a being capable of evil passions,
wrath, jealousy, &amp;c., who was identified with the Jehovah of the
Old <span class="nowrap">Testament.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></span> It required very little to confound this Demiurgus
with Satan, the Prince of this world; after which it was easy
to look upon Satan as a being not entirely evil, as Lucifer, son of
the morning, the disinherited son or brother of God, a natural
object of worship for the oppressed and <span class="nowrap">discontented.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></span></p>

<p>The serfs, equally tyrannized over by bishop and noble, the relics
of the persecuted sects Waldenses and <span class="nowrap">Cathari,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></span> sought refuge, like
Saul of old, in forbidden arts, and thus sects of Luciferans, or devil-​worshippers,
arose (especially in Germany and France) whose numbers
were exaggerated by the fear and horror of the <span class="nowrap">orthodox.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span></p>

<p>At the same time the devil acquired more importance in other
ways. That fearful calamity, the Black Death, seemed to display
his power over both the just and the unjust; while the Great
Schism in which each pope excommunicated the other, handing
him and his adherents over to Satan, put every one not absolutely
certain of being on the right side in reasonable fear of the powers of
darkness.</p>

<p>The belief in the great activity and power of the devil and his
servants the sorcerers was further supported by the vast authority
of St. Thomas Aquinas (1225–74), whose ingenuity enabled him
to explain away those ancient canons which seemed opposed to
the more extreme views. Thus the synod of Bracara (<span class="lowercase smcap">A.D</span>. 563)
had declared the doctrine that the devil can produce drought
or thunder-​storms to be heresy; to which the Doctor Angelicus
replied that though it is doubtless heresy to believe the devil can
make natural thunder-​storms, it is by no means contrary to the
Catholic faith to hold that he may, by the permission of God,
make artificial <span class="nowrap">ones.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span></p>

<p>For these and other reasons, the devil assumed greater prominence
during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries than ever
before. Men believed that he might appear to them from behind
every hedge or ruin, that his action was to be seen in almost all
pains and diseases, but that he was to be dreaded most of all when
he entered into a league with some man or woman. Thus everything
was ready for the outbreak of witch mania when, in 1484,
Pope Innocent VIII by his bull <i>Summis desiderantes</i> gave the
sanction of the Church to the popular beliefs concerning witches,
such as sexual intercourse with devils, destruction of crops, and
infliction of sterility and disease on man and beast.</p>

<p>The charge of sorcery had usually been employed in earlier
times either to check learned men who seemed to be going too far,
or tending to heresy in their researches, as in the case of the
physicians Arnold of Villanova (1240–1312) and Peter of Abano
(1250–1320), or to crush individuals and societies who were politically
dangerous, as with Joan of Arc, the Duchess of Gloucester,
and the Templars&mdash;the Church being called in to aid the civil
power. Now it was the Church which called upon the civil power
to assist in a crusade against witches and sorcerers as being the
worst and most dangerous of heretics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span></p>

<p>In the Middle Ages it was held that a man who called up the
devil, knowing it to be wrong, was not a heretic but merely a
sinner. But if he thought it was not wrong, or that the devil
would tell him the truth, or that the devil could do anything
without God’s permission, he was also a heretic, since these beliefs
are contrary to Church doctrine. In the fifteenth century it was
taught that all sorcerers are heretics, <i>maleficus</i> being, according to
the learned authors of the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>, a contraction of
<i>male de fide sentiens</i> or <span class="nowrap">heretic.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was the identification of heresy and witchcraft illogical,
whatever we may think of the etymology. The Church is the
kingdom of God, heretics form the kingdom of the devil, and just as
the Church possesses saints who see visions, work miracles, and
commune with Christ face to face, so there are specially eminent
heretics, saints of the devil’s church, who work miracles and have
obscene intercourse with their master. All true Christians are
potential saints, all heretics potential sorcerers, for all have committed
treason against the divine Majesty, though only some may
have entered into a definite compact with the enemy. The former,
if they repent, may hope for perpetual imprisonment; the latter
are to be put to death whether they repent or not.</p>

<p>This view was also of advantage to the Church, for it increased
the horror of heresy and facilitated its suppression. The laity had
never entirely reconciled themselves to the sight of their apparently
harmless neighbours being tortured and burnt for differences in
abstract belief, but almost every one was ready to torture and burn
a sorcerer, and local outbreaks of witch-​hunting were frequently
started by mob violence. In 1555 it was declared by the Peace of
Augsburg that no one should suffer in life and property for his
religion; but to take a Lutheran, call him a sorcerer, confiscate
his goods, and force him by torture to confess that he was led
into his errors by the devil himself, seems to have been too great
a temptation for the prince-​bishops who headed the ‘counter-​reformation’
in South Germany to resist. That this was partly
the cause of the great witch-​burnings in the bishoprics of
Würzburg, Bamberg, Fulda, and Trèves is evidenced by the
large proportion of male victims, and by the frequent and signi<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>ficant
appearance of the phrase ‘is also Lutheran’ in the official
reports.</p>

<p>As soon as the Reformation was established, Protestants vied
with Catholics as witch-​hunters. Eager to show that they were in
no way inferior to their opponents in zeal for the Lord and enmity
against Satan and his servants, they had the advantage of being
able to follow the scriptural injunction, ‘Thou shalt not suffer
a witch to live’, without previously explaining away ancient canons
and decrees of Church synods which seemed to throw doubt on the
very existence of the more typical forms of witchcraft. Nor did
they hesitate to attack their rivals with similar weapons. If Protestants
were burnt as sorcerers at Würzburg, we find the first
Danish Lutheran bishop, Peter Palladius, recommending the
zealous members of his flock to seek out the so-called wise women
of their neighbourhoods on pretence of having some disease. If
then the latter use paternosters, holy water, or invocations of saints,
they are probably not only Catholics but witches, and should be
treated <span class="nowrap">accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span></p>

<p>Almost all the victims of the witch mania were executed on
their own confession, extorted in the vast majority of instances
by torture or the fear of torture. In England, where torture was
theoretically illegal, confessions were comparatively rare, and
nearly all died protesting their innocence. The few exceptions
prove the rule; thus Elinor Shaw and Mary Philips, almost the last
witches legally executed in England, 1705, confessed because they
were threatened with death if they refused, and promised release
if they pleaded <span class="nowrap">guilty,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span> while others were induced to admit their
guilt by being kept awake several nights, and forced to run up
and down their cells till utterly exhausted, methods almost as
effectual in producing ‘a readiness to confess’ as the rack or
the <span class="nowrap">thumb-screw.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly all the confessions were to a similar effect. From
Lisbon to Liegnitz, from Calabria to Caithness, the central point
of the story was the ‘sabbat’, an assembly of witches and sorcerers
in some barren spot where they adored a visible devil, indulged in<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
feasts, dances, and sexual orgies, reported what evil they had done
and plotted more.</p>

<p>A few examples will therefore suffice, and they may be best
taken from the <span class="nowrap"><i>Daemanolatria</i><a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></span> of Nicholas Remy, Inquisitor of
Lorraine, who burned nearly 900 witches and sorcerers in fifteen
years, 1575–90.</p>

<p>He proves the reality of the witch dances as follows: A boy
named John of Haimbach confessed that his mother took him to
a sabbat to play the flute. He was told to climb up into a tree that
he might be heard the better, and was so amazed by what he saw
that he exclaimed: ‘Good God! where did this crowd of fools
and lunatics come from?’ Thereupon he fell from the tree and
found himself alone with a dislocated shoulder. Ottilia Velvers,
who was arrested soon after, confirmed the whole story, as did also
Eysarty Augnel, who was burnt the following year. So too,
Nicholas Langbernard, while going home in the early morning of
July 21, 1590, saw in full daylight a number of men and women
dancing back to back, some of them with cloven hoofs. He cried
out ‘Jesus’ and crossed himself, upon which all vanished except
a woman called Pelter, whose broomstick dropped, and who was
then carried off by a whirlwind. The grass was afterwards found
to be beaten down in a circle with marks of hoof-​prints. Pelter
and two other women were arrested and confessed they were
present, as also did John Michael, who said he was playing the flute
in a tree, and fell down when Nicholas crossed himself, but was
carried off in a whirlwind, his broomstick not being at hand.</p>

<p>‘What further evidence’, asks the inquisitor, ‘can any one
require?’ The only possible objection, viz. that they were phantoms
or spirits of people whose bodies were asleep in their beds, is
worthless, ‘it being the pious and Christian belief that soul and
body when once parted do not reunite till the day of judgement’.</p>

<p>The food at these sabbats usually included the flesh of unbaptized
children, and was always abominable. A certain Morel said
he was obliged to spit it out, at which the demon was much enraged.
‘Dancing opens a large window to wickedness,’ and is
therefore specially encouraged by the devil, but the dances cause
great exhaustion, just as his feasts cause loathing, and his money
changes to dung or potsherds. ‘Barberina Rahel, and nearly all
others, declared they had to lie in bed two days after a witch dance,
<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>but even the oldest cannot excuse themselves, and the devil beats
them if they are lazy.’ The music is horrible; every one sings or
plays what he likes, a favourite method being to drum on horse
skulls or trees. Sometimes the devil gives a concert of his own, at
which all are required to applaud and show pleasure; those who
do not are beaten so that they are sore for two days, as Joanna
Gransandeau confessed.</p>

<p>All are compelled to attend and give an account of their evil
deeds under heavy penalties. C.&nbsp;G. said ‘he was beaten till he
nearly died for failing to attend a sabbat, and for curing a girl whom
he had been told to poison. The devil also carried him up into the
air over the river Moselle, and threatened to drop him unless he
swore to poison a certain person.’ The witch Belhoria was attacked
by dropsy because she refused to poison her husband. If they
failed in their attempts on others, they were compelled to poison
their own children, or destroy their own property.</p>

<p>Antonius Welch was asked to lend his garden for a witch dance.
He refused, and found it full of snails and caterpillars. Men of
little faith have objected that only God can create, for ‘without
Him nothing is made that was made’; but why should not demons
collect vast numbers of insects in a moment? Look at the well-​known
rain of frogs, blood, &amp;c. This is doubtless done by devils
out of mere sport: how much more would they do for love of harm?
The making of thunder-​storms is harder to believe, but has been
admitted by more than 200 condemned witches and sorcerers.
Almost all confessed that they could creep into locked rooms and
houses in the form of small animals, and resuming their natural
shape commit all sorts of crimes, showing, says Remy, what a peril
they are to mankind.</p>

<p>A worthy comrade of Remy was Peter Binsfeld, suffragan
Bishop of Trèves and foremost opponent of John Weyer. He is
said to have burnt no fewer than 6,500 persons and to have so
desolated his diocese that in many villages round Trèves there was
scarcely a woman left. His <i>Tractatus de confessionibus</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>maleficorum</i><a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></span>
begins with the following case, which with those mentioned
above affords a complete view of the usual witch confessions.
John Kuno Meisenbein, a youth about eighteen years old, was
studying ‘poetry and the humaner letters’ at the High School in
Trèves, when he confessed to the authorities that his mother,<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
brother, sister, and self were all in league with the devil. He said
that in his ninth year his mother had initiated him as a sorcerer,
and had carried him up the chimney on a goat to a heath near
Trèves, where he took part in the usual sabbat and had intercourse
with a female demon named Capribarba. The mother, Anna
Meisenbein, a woman of good position, had already escaped to
Cologne, but a son and daughter were arrested, strangled, and
burned. ‘They died with much sorrow and penitence.’ The
eldest son, John Kuno, thereupon urged the judges to use all means
to capture his mother, ‘that by punishment and momentary death
in this world she might escape eternal damnation’.</p>

<p>Moved by this most creditable and merciful petition (<i>honestissima
et plenissima misericordiae petitione excitatus</i>), the prior wrote
to his friends at Cologne, and the unhappy woman was arrested and
taken back to Trèves. At first she protested her innocence, ‘but
when more severe tortures were employed’ she made the usual
admissions. Having lost a baby, she had, for a moment, doubted
the goodness of God. Whereupon a man in black raiment appeared
at the side of the bed, and promised if she would renounce
God and serve him he would give her peace of mind. She did so,
and he became her lover, and gave her money, which however
vanished. He called himself Fedderhans, and had asses’ feet.
Then follows the usual story of the sabbat. ‘This woman’, concludes
the bishop, ‘was burnt alive October 20, 1590, and had a
good end.’ They offered to behead John Kuno as a reward for his
filial piety and repentance, but he said he was unworthy of such
a favour and was therefore strangled and burnt. ‘He had a most
edifying end,’ says the bishop, who proceeds to comment upon
sexual intercourse between witches, sorcerers, and demons, ‘which
is so certain that it is an impudence to deny it, as St. Augustine
<span class="nowrap">saith,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span> being supported by the confessions of learned and unlearned,
and by all the doctors of the Church, though a few medical men,
advocates of the devil’s kingdom [an obvious reference to Weyer,
whom he abuses in the preface], have dared to deny <span class="nowrap">it’.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span></p>

<p>It is not our purpose to try and discover what amount of truth
is contained in the immense farrago of absurdities comprised in the<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
witch confessions. Actual nocturnal meetings of peasants, either
to celebrate heathen rites or to plot against their oppressors, or
merely to enjoy rude dances and music, as the negro in the Southern
States was supposed to play the banjo nightly after his labours on
the plantation, may or may not have assisted in spreading and
confirming the belief in the sabbat, but they were not necessary.
The whole story of child murder, obscene worship of a demon,
dances and sexual orgies, was ready to hand long before. It had
been applied in classic times to the worshippers of Isis and Bacchus,
by the pagans to the early Christians, by the orthodox to the first
heretics, to the Jews, to the Templars, and in our own day we have
seen very similar charges brought against the Freemasons. All
these sets of people had known meeting-​places&mdash;the witches had
none; they must therefore meet on some barren moor or mountain
and be carried there supernaturally. Once started, the belief
spread rapidly. Indeed we know from contemporary writers that
it was a common subject of village gossip, and if any wretched
victim had any doubt as to what she was expected to confess,
the gaoler and judges were always ready with hints or leading
questions.</p>

<p>One learned <span class="nowrap">German<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span> has attributed the whole witch mania to
the <i>Datura Stramonium</i>, or thorn-apple, a plant introduced into
Europe about this time. Women dosed themselves with this drug,
or applied it in ointments, and forthwith had hallucinations of
broomstick rides and witch dances. Others look upon belladonna
as the principal agent, and one ardent investigator took dangerous
doses of it in the hope of experiencing the adventures of a mediaeval
sorcerer, but without definite effect. A similar experiment has
recently been made by Kiesewetter, the historian of ‘Spiritualism’.
He used the witch ointments described by Baptista Porta and
others, but could produce nothing more diabolical than dreams of
travelling in an express <span class="nowrap">train.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span> Others, again, have supposed that
the badly baked rye bread of the period must have produced an
immense amount of nightmare among the poorer classes. The
power of suggestion, doubtless, had a very real influence both on
the victims and their judges, and with the aid of narcotics may not
infrequently have produced vivid dreams of dancing and other
intercourse with demons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span></p>

<p>No doubt many persons were quite ready to become witches
or sorcerers, and some really believed they had acquired such
powers. Cases are recorded in which formal agreements, duly
signed in blood, and awaiting the devil’s acceptance, were discovered,
and resulted in the arrest and burning of the would-be
wizard. Others took pleasure in the terror the reputed powers
inspired, and may have sometimes caused or increased it by the
use of actual poisons.</p>

<p>But these formed but a small minority of the vast army of
victims; and even when some real criminal was arrested or some
half-​insane person voluntarily ‘confessed’, she was encouraged or
compelled to denounce her supposed associates, and thus often
involved scores of innocent acquaintances in her own awful fate.</p>

<p>The witch-hunters are not to be blamed for believing in witchcraft,
or even for carrying out the scriptural injunction ‘Thou shalt
not suffer a witch to live’. It is the methods they employed, compared
with which the procedure of a Jeffreys or a Caiaphas was
just and merciful, which cannot be excused by any talk about the
spirit of the age, which brought agony and death to many thousands
of innocent men, women and little children, and which excited
the fiery and righteous indignation of Dr. John Weyer.</p>

<p>According to Pascal, men never do wrong so thoroughly and
so cheerfully as when they are obeying the promptings of a false
principle of conscience. To which we may add that men are never
more cruel and unjust than when they are in a fright. The witch-​hunters,
most of them at least, were pious and conscientious men.
They appeal to God, the Church, and the Bible at every step.
Nicholas Remy, for instance, after torturing and burning over 800
of his fellow creatures, retired from work thinking he had done God
and man good service. But one thing troubled his conscience.
He had spared the lives of certain young children, and merely
ordered them to be scourged naked three times round the place
where their parents were burning. He is convinced that this was
wrong, and that they will all grow up into witches and sorcerers.
Besides, if God sent two she-bears to slay the forty and two children
who mocked Elisha, of how much greater punishment are those
worthy who have done despite to God, His Mother, the saints, and
the Catholic <span class="nowrap">religion?<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span> He hopes his sinful clemency will not
become a precedent&mdash;a fear which was quite unnecessary, for scores<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
of children under twelve were burnt for witchcraft; and the one
plea which even then respited the most atrocious murderess did
not always avail a witch, since it was believed that her future child,
if not the actual offspring of the devil, would infallibly belong to his
kingdom.</p>

<p>But the witch-hunters were urged on by fear as well as by piety,
for not only did they think themselves exposed to personal attacks
from the devil and his allies, but they believed there was a vast
and increasing society of men and women in league with the evil
one, and that the fate of the world depended on its suppression.</p>

<p>All the machinery, therefore, which the Roman emperors had
devised for their protection against treason and the Church for
the suppression of heresy was brought into action against the
witches, for witchcraft was the acme of treason and heresy, a <i>crimen
laesae maiestatis divinae</i><span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span></p>

<p>For a description of the methods employed we cannot do
better than go to the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span> the guide and handbook
of the witch-hunters.</p>

<p>All proceedings in cases of witchcraft, say the reverend authors,
must be on the plan recommended by Popes Clement V and
Boniface VIII, ‘summarie, simpliciter, et de plano, ac sine strepitu
ac figura iudicii’, a harmless looking phrase which swept away
at a stroke all the safeguards which the lawyers of pagan Rome
and the ruder justice of ancient Gaul and Germany had placed
around accused persons. There are, says the <span class="nowrap"><i>Malleus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span> two forms
of criminal procedure: (1) the old legal or <i>accusatorial</i> form
where the prosecutor offers to prove his charge and to accept
the consequences of failure, which must be carefully avoided as
being dangerous and litigious; and (2) the <i>inquisitorial</i>, where a
man denounces another either from zeal for the faith, or because
called upon to do so, but takes no further part nor offers to prove
his charge, or where a man is suspected by common report and
the judge makes inquiry, and this method must always be preferred.
The inquisitors, on entering a new district, should issue
a proclamation calling on all persons to give information against<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
suspected witches on pain of excommunication and temporal
penalties. Any one may be compelled, by torture if necessary,
to give evidence, and if he refuses must be punished as an obstinate
heretic. Other sorcerers, or the man’s wife and family, are lawful
witnesses against, but not for, the accused. Criminals and perjured
persons, if they show zeal for the faith, may be admitted
to give evidence. Priests, nobles, graduates of universities, and
others legally exempt from torture are not exempt in the case of
witch <span class="nowrap">trials.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></span></p>

<p>‘Delation,’ the scandal of imperial Rome, was not only
encouraged but enforced, and in some places, as at Milan, boxes
were put in the churches, into which any one might drop an
anonymous denunciation of his neighbour.</p>

<p>Names of informers are not to be revealed under penalty of
excommunication; the advocate, if there is one, need be told
the charges only. This advocate must not be chosen by the
accused but by the inquisitor, and he must refuse the case if it
seems to him unjust or hopeless. He must not use legal quibbles
or make delays or appeals, and is to be specially warned that if
he be found a protector of heretics or a hinderer of the inquisition,
he will incur the usual penalties for those heinous crimes.
If he reply that he defends the person, not the error, this avails
not, for he must make no defence which interferes with proceeding
<i>summarie, simpliciter, et de plano</i><span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span> After this it is not surprising
to find that those accused of witchcraft were rarely defended by
an advocate.</p>

<p>Faith need be kept with heretics and sorcerers ‘for a time
<span class="nowrap">only’.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></span> Therefore an inquisitor may promise not to condemn
a person if he confesses, and then pass sentence after a few days,
or if of very tender conscience by the mouth of another. It is
also lawful to introduce persons, <i>etiam mulieres honestae</i>, to the
accused who promise to find means for their escape if they will
teach them some form of witchcraft. This, say the authors, is
a most successful method for getting <span class="nowrap">convictions.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span></p>

<p>Torture, though it may not be repeated on the same charge,
may be continued as long as necessary, and any fresh evidence
justifies a repetition. Finally the accused may be burnt without
confession if the evidence is strong enough, or he may be kept<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
in prison for months or years, when the <i>squalor carceris</i> may
induce him to confess his <span class="nowrap">crimes.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the proceedings recommended against persons suspected
of or denounced for witchcraft, and they conclude appropriately
with the hideously hypocritical formula with which they
were delivered over to be burnt: ‘Relinquimus te potestati
curiae secularis, deprecantes tamen illam ut erga te citra sanguinis
effusionem et mortis periculum suam sententiam <span class="nowrap">moderetur’,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></span>
which means, according to the <i>Malleus</i>, that sorcerers are to be
burned even though they repent, while repentant heretics may
be imprisoned for life.</p>

<p>What was meant by the <i>squalor carceris</i> may be seen from the
following description by an eye-​witness, <span class="nowrap">Pretorius:<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Some [of the dungeons] are holes like cellars or wells, fifteen
to thirty fathoms (?) deep with openings above, through which
they let down the prisoners with ropes and draw them up when
they will. Such prisons I have seen myself. Some sit in great
cold, so that their feet are frost-​bitten or frozen off, and afterwards,
if they escape, they are crippled for life. Some lie in
continual darkness, so that they never see a ray of sunlight, and
know not whether it be night or day. All of them have their
limbs confined so that they can hardly move, and are in continual
unrest, and lie in their own refuse, far more filthy and wretched
than cattle. They are badly fed, cannot sleep in peace, have
much anxiety, heavy thoughts, bad dreams. And since they
cannot move hands or feet, they are plagued and bitten by lice,
rats, and other vermin, besides being daily abused and threatened
by gaolers and executioners. And since all this sometimes lasts
months or years, such persons, though at first they be courageous,
rational, strong, and patient, at length become weak, timid,
hopeless, and if not quite, at least half idiotic and desperate.’</p></div>

<p>Yet all this was not considered torture, and if some poor
wretch, after a year of it, went mad, or preferred a quick death
to a slow one, her confession was described as being ‘entirely
voluntary and without torture’.</p>

<p>As to the torture itself, it combined all that the ferocity of
savages and the ingenuity of civilized man had till then invented.
Besides the ordinary rack, thumb-​screws, and leg-​crushers or
Spanish boots, there were spiked wheels over which the victims
were drawn with weights on their feet; boiling oil was poured on<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
their legs, burning sulphur dropped on their bodies, and lighted
candles held beneath their armpits. At Bamberg they were fed
on salt fish and allowed no water, and then bathed in scalding
water and quicklime. At Lindheim they were fixed to a revolving
table and whirled round till they vomited and became unconscious,
and on recovery remained in so dazed a state that they
were ready to confess <span class="nowrap">anything.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></span> At Neisse they were fastened
naked in a chair ‘with 150 finger-long spikes in it’ and kept
there for hours. And so effective were these tortures that nine
out of ten innocent persons preferred to die as confessed sorcerers
rather than undergo a repetition of them.</p>

<p>The Jesuit Father Spee, a worthy successor of John Weyer,
accompanied nearly two hundred victims to the stake at Würzburg
in less than two years. At the end of this time his hair had turned
grey and he seemed twenty years older, and on being questioned
as to the cause, declared that he was convinced that all these
persons were innocent. They had, he said, at first repeated the
usual confession, but on being tenderly dealt with had one and
all protested their innocence, adjuring him at the same time not
to reveal this, for they would much rather die than be tortured
again. He added that he had received similar reports from other
father <span class="nowrap">confessors.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></span> A few years later, 1631, he plucked up courage
to publish anonymously his <i>Cautio Criminalis</i>, in which he
exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Why do we search so diligently for sorcerers? I will show
you at once where they are. Take the Capuchins, the Jesuits, all
the religious orders, and torture them&mdash;they will confess. If
some deny, repeat it a few times&mdash;they will confess. Should
a few still be obstinate, exorcise them, shave them: they use
sorcery, the devil hardens them, only keep on torturing&mdash;they
will give in. If you want more, take the Canons, the Doctors,
the Bishops of the Church&mdash;they will confess. How should the
poor delicate creatures hold out? If you want still more, I will
torture you and then you me. I will confess the crimes you will
have confessed, and so we shall all be sorcerers <span class="nowrap">together.’<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span></p>

<p>In the most notorious of judicial murders, we read that the
judges had some difficulty owing to a disagreement between the
witnesses. This rarely troubled the witch-​hunters. At Lindheim
a woman was accused of having dug up and carried off the body
of an infant, which, under torture, she admitted, denouncing four
others as her accomplices. But on the grave being opened, the
body was found uninjured. The inquisitors at once decided that
this must be a delusion of the devil, and all five women were
burned. A man confessed, under torture, that he was a were-wolf,
and in that form had killed a calf belonging to a neighbour;
the latter, however, said he had never lost a calf, though two or
three years ago two hens had disappeared, he believed through
witchcraft. The accused was burnt, for what need had they of
witnesses? Had they not heard his <span class="nowrap">confession?<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></span></p>

<p>It was even laid down as a principle that doubtful points
must be decided ‘in favour of the faith’&mdash;in other words, against
the accused. ‘If a sorcerer retracts his denunciations at the
stake, it is not void, for he may have been corrupted by friends
of the accused. Also when witnesses vary, as they often do, the
positive assertion is always to be believed,’ says Bishop Covarivias,
a prominent member of the Council of Trent. In which he is
supported by the jurist Menochius of Padua, ‘ne tam horrendum
crimen occultum sit’.</p>

<p>Anything might start a witch-hunting, and once started it
increased like an avalanche. If an old woman happened to be
out of doors in a thunder-​storm; if the winter was prolonged;
if there was a more than usual number of flies and caterpillars;
if a woman had a spite against her neighbour, some one might be
denounced and forced in turn to denounce others. The prolonged
winter of 1586 in Savoy, for instance, resulted in the
burning of 113 women and two men, who confessed, after torture,
that it was due to their incantations.</p>

<p>It is thus not difficult to understand how, in the diocese of
Como, witches were burnt for many years at an average rate of 100
per annum; how in that of Strassburg 5,000 were burnt in twenty
years, 1615–35; how in the small diocese of Neisse 1,000 suffered
between 1640–50, insomuch that they gave up the stake and pile
as being too costly, and roasted them in a specially prepared oven;
and how the Protestant jurist Benedict Carpzov could boast not<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
only of having read the Bible through fifty-​three times, but also
of having passed 20,000 death sentences, chiefly on witches and
<span class="nowrap">sorcerers.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span></p>

<p>One of Carpzov’s victims is specially interesting to medical
men, the Saxon physician, Dr. Veit Pratzel, who on one occasion
(1660) produced twenty mice by sleight of hand in a public-​house,
probably for the sake of advertisement. He was denounced as
a sorcerer, tortured and burnt, while his children were bled to
death in a warm bath by the executioner, lest they should acquire
similar diabolical <span class="nowrap">powers.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></span></p>

<p>A like fate befell the servant of a travelling dentist at Schwersenz
in Poland. The dentist, John Plan, left his assistant in the
town to attract attention by conjuring tricks, while he went to
sell his infallible toothache tinctures in the neighbouring villages.
On his return next evening, he was horrified to see the body of
the unfortunate man hanging on the town gallows, and was told
on inquiry that he was an evident sorcerer who had made eggs,
birds, and plants before everybody in the market-​place. He had
therefore been arrested, scourged, put on the rack, and otherwise
tortured till he confessed he was in league with the devil.
Whereupon the town council, ‘out of special grace and to save
expense’, had, instead of burning him, mercifully condemned him
to be hanged. The dentist fled in terror to <span class="nowrap">Breslau.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span></p>

<p>But it was by no means necessary to be so foolhardy as this
to fall into the hands of the witch-​hunters. A woman at Lindheim
was noticed to run into her barn as the inquisitorial officials
came down the street. She had never been accused or even suspected
of witchcraft, but was nevertheless immediately arrested,
and brought more dead than alive to the chief inquisitor, <span class="nowrap">Geiss,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></span>
who declared her flight justified the strongest suspicion. Exposed
to the most extreme torture, she confessed nothing, but at length,
at the question whether she had made a compact with the devil,
one of the inquisitors declared he saw her nod her head. This
was enough; she was burnt; probably a happy fate under the
circumstances, for she thus escaped being forced by further
tortures to give details of her imaginary crime and to denounce
her neighbours.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span></p>
<p>Once in the clutches of the witch-​hunters, the unfortunate
victim was confronted by a series of dilemmas from which few
escaped. A favourite beginning was to ask whether he believed
in witchcraft. If he said ‘Yes’, he evidently knew more of the
subject; if ‘No’, he was <i>ipso facto</i> a heretic and slanderer of the
inquisition; if in confusion he tried to distinguish, he was <i>varius
in confessionibus</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></span> and a fit subject for immediate torture. If he
confessed under torture, the matter was, of course, settled; if he
endured manfully, it was evident that the devil must be aiding
him. If a mark could be found on his body which was insensible
and did not bleed when pricked, it was the devil’s seal and a sure
sign of guilt; but if there was none, his case was no better, for
it was held that the devil only marked those whose fidelity he
doubted, so that a suspected person who had no such mark was in
all probability a specially eminent <span class="nowrap">sorcerer.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the water test, of which there is no better account
than the report sent by W. A. Scribonius, Professor of Philosophy
at Marburg, to the town council of Lemgo in 1583:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘When I came to you, most prudent and learned consules,
26th September, there were, two days later on St. Michael’s eve,
three witches burnt alive for divers and horrible crimes. The
same day three others, denounced by those aforesaid, were arrested,
and on the following day about 2&nbsp;p.m. for further proving of the
truth were thrown into water to see whether they would swim or
not. Their clothes were removed and they were bound by the
right thumb to the left big toe and vice versa, so that they could
not move in the least. They were then cast three times into the
water in the presence of some thousands of spectators, and floated
like logs of wood, nor did one of them sink. And it is also remarkable
that almost at the moment they touched the water a shower
of rain then falling ceased, and the sun shone, but when they
were taken out it started raining as before.’</p></div>

<p>On request of the burgomaster, he investigated ‘the philosophy’
of this, and, though he could find nothing definite, had
no doubt of its value as a test of witchcraft. ‘The physician
Weyer rejects it as absurd and fallacious, but he can produce no
good arguments or examples against it, and may therefore be
ignored.’ Perhaps witches are made lighter because possessed
by demons who are ‘powers of the air’ and often carry them<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
through the air. All who float have afterwards confessed, therefore
though not scriptural nor of itself sufficient to convict, the
swimming test is not to be <span class="nowrap">despised.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the number of victims, even sober historians,
such as Soldan, speak of millions, but if we take three-​quarters of
a million for the two centuries 1500–1700, it will give a rate of ten
executions daily, at least eight of which were judicial murders.</p>

<p>Even more pathetic than the notice of 800 condemned in one
body by the senate of <span class="nowrap">Savoy<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span> are the long lists of yearly executions
preserved in the fragmentary records of small towns and
villages. Thus at Meiningen, between 1610–31 and 1656–85, 106
suffered&mdash;in 1610 three, 1611 twenty-​two, 1612 four, &amp;c. &amp;c., the
intervening records being omitted owing to war. Similar notices
have survived at Waldsee, Thun in Alsace, and many other hamlets,
where through a long series of years we read of one to twenty
persons burnt annually, some of them being previously ‘torn with
red-hot <span class="nowrap">pincers’.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span></p>

<p>At Würzburg the Prince-bishop, Philip of Ehrenberg, is said to
have burnt 900 in five years (1627–31), and we have terrible lists of
twenty-​nine of the burnings, almost all of which include young
children. Here are two of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In the thirteenth burning, four persons: the old court smith,
an old woman, a little girl of nine or ten years, a younger girl her
sister.’</p>

<p>‘In the twentieth burning, six persons: Babelin Goebel, the
prettiest girl in Würzburg; a student in the fifth form who knew
many languages and was an excellent musician, instrumental and
vocal; two boys from the new minster, twelve years old; Babel
Stepper’s daughter; the caretaker on the <span class="nowrap">bridge.’<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span></p></div>

<p>At Bamberg the Prince-bishop, John George, 1625–30, burnt
at least 600 persons, and his predecessors had been hardly less
vigorous witch-​hunters. He was ably seconded by his suffragan,
Bishop Förner, and two doctors of law, Braun and Kötzendörffer,
who besides the ordinary torture implements, salt fish and quicklime
baths, found a so-called prayer stool or bench covered with<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
spikes, on which the victim was forced to kneel, and a cage with
a sharp ridged floor on which he could not stand, sit, or lie without
torment, of great value in extorting confessions. The record of
their deeds has been published by Dr. F. <span class="nowrap">Leitschuh,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span> librarian of
Bamberg, and contains, among other cases, that of the Burgomaster,
John Junius, which throws more light on the nature of the
witch trials than do volumes of second-hand <span class="nowrap">history.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span></p>

<p>John Junius, a man universally respected, had been five times
Burgomaster of Bamberg, and held that office in June 1628, when
he was arrested on a charge of sorcery. He protested his innocence
though six witnesses declared, under torture, that they had seen
him at the witch dances. On June 30 he endured the torment of
the thumb-​screws and leg-​crushers (Spanish boots) without confession.
Then they stuck pins in him and found a ‘devil’s mark’,
and finally drew him up with his arms twisted backwards, but he
would admit nothing. Next day, however, when threatened with
a repetition of the torture, he broke down, made the usual
confession (including intercourse with a female demon who turned
into a he-goat), and denounced twenty-​seven persons whose names
and addresses are <span class="nowrap">given.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></span> He was condemned to be beheaded
and burnt, but before his death wrote the following letter to his
daughter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Many hundred thousand good-nights, my dearest daughter
Veronica! Guiltless was I taken to prison, guiltless have I been
tortured, guiltless I must die. For whoever comes here must
either be a sorcerer, or is tortured until (God pity him) he makes
up a confession of sorcery out of his head. I’ll tell you how I fared.
When I was questioned the first time, there were present Dr.
Braun, Dr. Kötzendörffer, and two strangers. Dr. Braun asked me,
“Friend, how came you hither?” I answered, “Through lies and
misfortune.” “Hear you,” said he, “you’re a sorcerer. Confess it
willingly or we’ll bring witnesses and the executioner to you.”
I said, “I am no sorcerer. I have a clear conscience on this matter,
and care not for a thousand witnesses, but am ready to hear them.”
Then the chancellor’s son, Dr. Haan, was brought out. I asked,
“Herr Doctor, what do you know of me? I never had anything to
do with you, good or bad.” He answered, “Sir, it is a judgement
matter, excuse me for witnessing against you. I saw you at the
dances.” “Yes, but how?” He did not know. Then I asked the
commissioners to put him on oath, and examine him properly.
<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>“The thing is not to be arranged as you want it,” said Dr. Braun;
“it is enough that he saw you.” I said, “What sort of witness is
that? If things are so managed, you are as little safe as I or any
other honourable person.” Next came the chancellor and said the
same as his son. He had seen me, but had not looked carefully to
see who I was. Then Elsa Hopffen. She had seen me dancing on
Haupt’s moor. Then came the executioner and put on the thumb-​screws,
my hands being tied together, so that the blood spurted
from under the nails, and I cannot use my hands these four weeks,
as you may see by this writing. Then they tied my hands behind
and drew me up. I thought heaven and earth were disappearing.
Eight times they drew me up and let me fall so that I suffered
horrible agony. All which time I was stark naked, for they had
me stripped.</p>

<p>‘But our Lord God helped me, and I said to them, “God forgive
you for treating an innocent man like this; you want not only to
destroy body and soul, but also to get the goods and chattels.”
[At Bamberg, two-​thirds of the property of convicted sorcerers
went to the bishop, and the rest to the inquisitors.] “You’re a
rascal,” said Dr. Braun. I replied, “I am no rascal, but as respectable
as any of you; but if things go on like this, no respectable man
in Bamberg will be safe, you as little as I or another.” The doctor
said he had no dealings with the devil. I said, “Nor have I. Your
false witnesses are the devils, your horrible tortures. You let no
one go, even though he has endured all your torments.”</p>

<p>‘It was Friday, 30th June, that, with God’s help, I endured these
tortures. I have ever since been unable to put my clothes on
or use my hands, besides the other pains I had to suffer innocently.</p>

<p>‘When the executioner took me back to prison, he said to me,
“Sir, for God’s sake confess something, whether true or not.
Think a little. You can’t stand the tortures they’ll inflict on you,
and even if you could you wouldn’t escape, though you were a
count, but they’ll go through them again and again and never
leave you till you say you are a sorcerer, as may be seen by all their
judgements, for all end alike.” Another came and said the bishop
had determined to make an example of me which would astonish
people, and begged me for God’s sake to make up something, for
I should not escape even though I were innocent, and so said
Neudecker and others.</p>

<p>‘Then I asked to see a priest, but could not get one<span class="ell">...</span>. And
then this is my confession as follows, but all of it lies.</p>

<p>‘Here follows, dearest child, what I confessed that I might
escape the great torments and agonies, for I could not have endured
them any longer. This is my confession, nothing but lies, that
I had to make on threat of still greater tortures, and for which
I must die.</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
<p>‘“I went into my field, and sat down there in great melancholy,
when a peasant girl came to me and said, ‘Sir, what is the matter?
Why are you so sorrowful?’ I said I did not know, and then she
sat down close to me, and suddenly changed into a he-goat and
said, ‘Now you know with whom you have to do.’ He took me by
the throat and said, ‘You must be mine, or I’ll kill you.’ Then
I said, ‘God forbid.’ Then he vanished and came back with two
women and three men; bade me deny God, and I did so, denied
God and the heavenly host. Then he baptized me and the two
women were sponsors; gave me a ducat, which turned into a potsherd.”</p>

<p>‘Now I thought I had got it over, but they brought in the
executioner, and asked where I went to the witch dances. I did
not know what to say, but remembered that the chancellor and his
son and Elsa Hopffen had mentioned Haupt’s moor and other places,
so I said the same. Then I was asked whom I had seen there.
Replied I did not recognize any. “You old rascal, I must get the
executioner to you. Was the chancellor there?” Said “Yes.”
“Who else?” “I recognized none.” Then he said, “Take street
by street, beginning from the market.” Then I had to name some
persons. Then Long Street. I knew nobody; had to name eight
persons<span class="ell">...</span>. Did I know any one in the castle? I must speak
out boldly whoever it was. So they took me through all the streets
till I could and would say no more. Then they gave me to the
executioner to strip, shave off my hair, and torture me again.
“The rascal knows a man in the market-​place, goes about with him
daily, and won’t name him.” They meant Dietmeyer, so I had to
name him.</p>

<p>‘Next they asked what evil I had done. I replied, “None.”
The devil bade me to, and beat me when I refused. “Put the
rascal on the rack.” So I said I was told to murder my children
but killed a horse instead. That wasn’t enough for them. I had
also taken a sacramental wafer and buried it. When I said this
they left me in peace.</p>

<p>‘There, dearest child, you have all my confession, for which
I must die, and it is nothing but lies and made-up things, so God
help me. For I had to say all this for fear of the tortures threatened
me, besides all those I had gone through. For they go on
torturing till one confesses something; be he as pious as he will, he
must be a sorcerer. No one escapes, though he were a count.
And if God does not interfere, all our friends and relations will be
burnt, for each has to confess as I had.</p>

<p>‘Dearest child, I know you are pious as I, but you have already
had some trouble, and if I may advise, you had better take what
money there is and go on a pilgrimage for six months, or somewhere
where you can stay for a time outside the diocese till one sees what
<span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>will happen. Many honourable men and women in Bamberg go to
church and about their business, do no evil, and have clear consciences
as I hitherto, as you know, yet they come to the witch
prison, and if they have a tongue to confess, confess they must,
true or not.</p>

<p>‘Neudecker, the chancellor, his son, Candelgiesser, Hofmeister’s
daughter, and Elsa Hopffen all denounced me at once. I had no
chance. Many are in the same case, and many more will be, unless
God intervenes.</p>

<p>‘Dear child, keep this letter secret so that nobody sees it, or
I shall be horribly tortured and the gaoler will lose his head, so
strict is the rule against it. You may let Cousin Stamer read it
quickly in private. He will keep it secret. Dear child, give this
man a thaler.</p>

<p>‘I have taken some days to write this. Both my hands are
lamed. I am in a sad state altogether. I entreat you by the last
judgement, keep this letter secret, and pray for me after my death
as for your martyred father <span class="ell">..</span>. but take care no one hears of
this letter. Tell Anna Maria to pray for me too. You may take
oath for me that I am no sorcerer, but a martyr.</p>

<p>‘Good-night, for your father, John Junius, will see you never
more.</p>

<p>24th July, 1628.’</p></div>

<p>On the margin is written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Dear child, six denounced me: the chancellor, his son,
Neudecker, Zaner, Ursula Hoffmaister, and Elsa Hopffen, all
falsely and on compulsion as they all confessed. They begged my
pardon for God’s sake before they were executed. They said they
knew nothing of me but what was good and loving. They were
obliged to name me, as I should find out myself. I cannot have
a priest, so take heed of what I have written, and keep this letter
secret.’</p></div>

<p>The letter is still preserved, with its crippled handwriting, in the
library at Bamberg. This case is beyond comment. It is like the
trial of Faithful at Vanity Fair, but with rack and thumb-​screw in
place of a jury. Yet it is but a moderate sample of those outrages
on justice and humanity called witch trials. Men rarely held out
long, but, did space permit, we might tell stories of many heroic
women who endured ten, twenty, even fifty repetitions of torture,
till they died on the rack or in the dungeon rather than falsely
accuse themselves or their <span class="nowrap">neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="213"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span></p>
<p>For when once arrested, the victim had small hope of acquittal,
and in the most favourable cases, when there was no external
evidence, and no amount of torture could induce a ‘confession’,
the accused was sent back friendless and crippled to her home,
which she was forbidden to leave, having first sworn to have no
more dealings with the devil, and to take no proceedings against
her accusers. To acquit her would imply that an innocent person
had been tortured, a thing naturally repugnant to the tender consciences
of the inquisitors.</p>

<p>Nor was the mania confined to any special class. Protestants
vied with Catholics, and town councils with bishops in cruelty and
injustice. At Nördlingen they had a special set of torture instruments
which the Protestant town council lent to neighbouring
district authorities, with the pious observation that ‘by these
means, and more especially by the thumb-​screw, God has often
been graciously pleased to reveal the truth, if not at first, at any
rate at the <span class="nowrap">last’.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></span></p>

<p>It is obvious from the above cases that the main cause of the
continuance of the witch-​burnings, and of the number of the
victims, was the use of torture to obtain denunciations. The
instances in which insane persons accused themselves or others
seem to have been fewer than we might have expected.</p>

<p>Then, as now, there were melancholics who thought they had
committed the unpardonable sin, and in those days the unpardonable
sin might be represented by an imaginary compact with the
devil. Then, as now, the ‘mania of persecution’ was a prominent
symptom in some forms of insanity, and the idea of being bewitched
by some old woman corresponded to the modern dread of detectives,
electric batteries, or telephones.</p>

<p>Some of the supposed signs of witchcraft resemble those of
mania and melancholia. Thus maniacs sometimes collect dirt for
money, and witches often confessed that the devil’s money changed
to dirt. Melancholics mutter to themselves, look on the ground,
and avoid society, all of which were considered signs of witchcraft.
But then red hair and left-​handedness were no less infallible indications.</p>

<p>Insanity and crime were indeed present at the witch trials, but
they were at least as obvious in the accusers and judges as in the<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
victims, and the first man who was bold enough to say so was
Dr. John Weyer. Though a few feeble protests may have been
made by others, it was from the medical profession that the first
determined opposition came. Mystics like Paracelsus and Cardan
might encourage the superstition; pious and able members of the
profession like Ambroise Paré and Sir Thomas Brown might give it
their sanction, but it was the physician Cornelius Agrippa who first
successfully defended a witch at the risk of his own <span class="nowrap">life,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></span> and it
was his pupil John Weyer who first declared open war against the
witch-​hunters and invoked the vengeance of heaven upon their
atrocities.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The feareful abounding at this time in this countrie of those
detestable slaves of the divell, the witches or enchanters hath
moved me (beloved reader) to dispatch in post the following
treatise of mine, not in any wise (as I protest) to serve for a shewe
of my learning and ingine, but only (moved of conscience to preasse
thereby) so far as I can, to resolve the doubting hearts of manie
both that such assaults of Satan are most certainly practised, and
that the instruments thereof merit most severely to be punished,
against the damnable opinions of two principally in our age,
whereof the one called Scot, an Englishman, is not ashamed in
public print to denie that there can be such a thing as witchcraft
and so maintains the old error of the Sadduces in denying of spirits,
the other called Wierus, a German physition sets out a publike
apologie for all these crafts-​folks, whereby procuring for their
impunity, he plainly bewrayes himself to have been of that profession.’</p></div>

<p>Thus did our ‘British Solomon’, James I, commence his <i>Daemonologia</i>
(1598), a work directed against the two men who alone
up to that time had made a bold and open protest against the witch
mania and its abominations. Reginald Scot in his <i>Discovery of
Witchcraft</i> (1584) took the view of a modern common-sense Englishman,
that the whole thing is absurd, a mixture of roguery and
false accusations. Weyer, on the other hand, his predecessor by
twenty years, is a firm believer in the activity of the devil, whose
object, however, is not to get possession of the souls of crazy old
women, but by deluding them, to convert pious and learned
lawyers and theologians into torturers and murderers.</p>

<p>Born about 1516 at Grave in Brabant, the son of a dealer in
hops and faggots, Weyer was acquainted with the supernatural<span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
from his earliest years, for they had a domestic ‘house cobold’ or
<i>Poltergeist</i>, who was heard tumbling the hop-sacks about whenever
a customer was expected. At seventeen years of age the
boy was sent to study medicine as apprentice to Cornelius Agrippa,
an extraordinary man, long held to be a sorcerer, who had recently
incurred yet stronger suspicion by his heroic and successful defence
of a woman accused of witchcraft at Metz, and by his fondness for
a black dog called ‘Monsieur’ which scarcely ever left him. The
young Weyer used to take this animal out on a string, and soon
became convinced, to use his own words, that it was ‘a perfectly
natural male <span class="nowrap">dog’.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></span> He next went to Paris and thence to Orleans,
a university then famous for its medical school, where he took the
degree of M.D. in 1537. He commenced practice in Brabant,
became public medical officer at Arnheim in 1545, and in 1550
physician to Duke William of Cleves. In 1563 he published his
great work <i>De praestigiis daemonum et incantationibus ac veneficiis</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></span>
the object of which is to show that so-called witchcraft is usually
due to delusions of demons, who take advantage of the weaknesses
and diseases of women to bring about impious and absurd superstitions,
hatreds, cruelties, and a vast outpouring of innocent blood,
things in which they naturally delight.</p>

<p>He proposes to treat the subject under four heads corresponding
to the four faculties, theology, philosophy, medicine, and law. In
the first section he attempts to show that the Hebrew word <i>Kasaph</i>
does not mean ‘witch’ but ‘poisoner’, or at any rate that Greek,
Latin, and Rabbinical interpreters so vary, that no reliance can
be placed upon them. Moreover the law of Moses was given to the
Jews ‘for the hardness of their hearts’, and is by no means always
to be used by <span class="nowrap">Christians.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></span> Magicians and sorcerers do indeed still
exist, as in ancient Egypt, but these are always men, and usually
rogues and swindlers, such as was Faust, of whom Weyer gives us
one of the earliest and most authentic notices. Faust, he says, was
once arrested by Baron Hermann of Batoburg, and given in charge
of his chaplain, J. Dursten, who hoping to see some sign or wonder,
treated him with much kindness, giving him the best of wine. But
all he got out of him was a magic ointment to enable him to shave
without a razor, containing arsenic, and so strong that it brought<span class="pagenum" title="216"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>
not only the hair but the skin from the reverend gentleman’s cheeks.
‘The which he has told me more than once with much <span class="nowrap">indignation.’<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></span></p>

<p>Weyer, however, firmly believes that the devil may assist sorcerers,
such as Faust, in some of their feats, though he does this
chiefly by deluding the eyes of the spectators. He may also delude
women into the belief that they have been at witch dances and
caused thunder-​storms, &amp;c., but his greatest deception is to make
men believe in the reality of witchcraft and so torture and murder
the <span class="nowrap">innocent.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></span> Women are more liable to his deceptions owing to
their greater instability both of mind and body, and the delusion
may be favoured by the use of drugs and ointments, especially
those containing belladonna, lolium, henbane, opium, and even more
by herbs recently introduced from east and west, such as Indian
hemp, datura, ‘and the plant called by the Indians “tabacco”,
by the Portuguese “peto”, and by the French <span class="nowrap">“nicotiana”’.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></span></p>

<p>As for the supposed compact with the devil, it is an absurdity
only surpassed by the belief in sexual intercourse with demons.
This delusion, Weyer points out, may be explained medically by the
phenomena of nightmare and the effects of certain drugs, and is
not sanctioned by Scripture. For, though holy men such as
Lactantius, Justin Martyr, and Tertullian have maintained that
the ‘sons of God’ mentioned in Genesis vi. 2 were spirits, this
interpretation is opposed by still more eminent theologians, such
as Saints Jerome, Gregory Nazianzen, and Chrysostom, though he
is obliged to admit that St. Augustine believed in <i>incubi</i> and
<span class="nowrap"><i>succubae</i>,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></span> and that distinguished living theologians hold that
Luther’s father was literally the devil. This, however, says
Weyer, is an unfair and prejudiced way of attacking the Lutheran
<span class="nowrap">heresy.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></span></p>

<p>People who fancy themselves bewitched are really possessed or
assaulted by the devil, as were Job and the demoniacs of the New
Testament. If these demoniacs had lived in our days, he remarks,
they would probably have each cost the lives of numerous old
<span class="nowrap">women.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></span> The strange objects vomited by such persons are either
deceptions or put into the person’s mouth by the devil, as is shown
by there being no admixture of food, and the absence of pain or
injury in spite of the size of the <span class="nowrap">objects.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="217"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span></p>

<p>A girl near Cleves fell into convulsions with clenched hands and
teeth which, according to her father, could only be opened by
making the sign of the cross. She also complained of pains for
which it was necessary to buy a bottle of holy water from a priest
at Amersfort, on drinking which she proceeded to vomit pins,
needles, scraps of iron, and pieces of cloth. She spoke in an altered
boyish voice, intended for that of a demon, and declared the whole
was caused by an ‘in my opinion honest matron’, who was imprisoned
with her mother and two other women.</p>

<p>Weyer undertook the case, ‘whereupon she said in her boy’s
voice she would have nothing to do with me, and that I was a cunning
fellow. “Look what sharp eyes he has.”’ Weyer opened her
hands and mouth, without making the sign of the cross, ‘not that
I would in any way speak irreverently thereof’. He also showed
that the objects produced, even soon after eating, were free from
admixture of food, and had therefore never been farther than the
mouth; and he thus obtained the release of the four women after
a month’s <span class="nowrap">imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></span></p>

<p>As for the stories of men changed into animals, they are partly
poetic and moral allegories, as the sailors of Ulysses, and partly
a form of insanity long recognized by physicians, and termed
<span class="nowrap">lycanthropy.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></span></p>

<p>Many think they are possessed when they are only melancholic,
and others pretend to be so to excite interest and obtain money.
Those who fancy themselves attacked by devils should, instead
of accusing their neighbours, take to themselves the armour of
God as described by St. Paul. Unfortunately, spiritual pastors,
in their ignorance and greed, teach that not only diabolical possession,
but even ordinary diseases are to be cured by charms, incantations,
palm branches, consecrated candles, and an execrable
abuse of scriptural words. Cures are, indeed, sometimes so produced,
but are really due to the imagination.</p>

<p>Persons supposed to be possessed should first be taken to an
intelligent physician, who should investigate and treat any bodily
disorder. Should spiritual disorders be also present he may then
send the patient to a pious minister of the Church, but this will
often be unnecessary. The devil is especially fond of attacking
nuns, who should be separated from the rest, and, if possible, sent
home to their <span class="nowrap">relations.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span></p>
<p>Here Weyer inserts several instances in his own experience.</p>

<p>Philip Wesselich, a monk of Knechtenstein near Cologne, an
honest, simple-​minded man, was miserably afflicted by a spirit
about the year 1550. Sometimes he was carried up to the roof,
at others thrust in among the beams of the belfry, often carried
unexpectedly through the wall (<i>plerumque per murum transferebatur
inopinato</i>) and knocked about generally. At length the
spirit declared he was Matthew Duren, a former abbot, condemned
to penance for having paid an artist insufficiently for a painting of
the Blessed Virgin, so that the poor man went bankrupt and committed
suicide, ‘which was true’. He could only be released if
the monk went to Trèves and Aix and recited three masses in the
respective cathedrals. The theological faculty of Cologne advised
that he should do so, but the abbot Gerard, a man of firmness and
intelligence, told the possessed man that he was a victim of diabolical
deceptions, and that unless he put his trust in God, and
pulled himself together, he should be publicly whipped. Whereupon
the monk did so, and the devil left him and went <span class="nowrap">elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></span></p>

<p>A similar case was that of a young woman known to Weyer, who
had convulsions in church whenever the ‘Gloria in excelsis’ was
sung in German, and said she was possessed. It was observed,
however, that she looked about for a soft place to fall on. She
was therefore sent for by Weyer’s friend the Countess Anna of
Virmont, who said she was about to sing the chant, and that if the
demon attacked her she would soon drive him out. The young
woman fell in the usual fit, on which the countess, <i>prudens et
cordata matrona</i>, with the aid of her daughter pulled up her dress
and gave her a good whipping. ‘She confessed to me afterwards
that it completely cured her.’ Extreme diseases, adds Weyer,
require, according to Hippocrates, extreme remedies, but care
should be taken to distinguish suitable <span class="nowrap">cases.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></span></p>

<p>The last and most important section of the book treats of the
punishment of witches, who are to be carefully distinguished from
poisoners and magicians, such as Faust, who are often wealthy men
and spend much money in travel, books, &amp;c., to learn diabolic arts;
or deceivers, such as the mason who buried wolves’ dung in a cattle
stall, and when the animals showed great excitement, said they
were bewitched, and offered to cure them for a consideration. Such
men, when proved to have done serious harm, are to be severely<span class="pagenum" title="219"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
punished. The less guilty should be admonished, and among them
are those who spread superstitious practices and persuade sick
people that they are bewitched by some old woman.</p>

<p>This is all that the laws of Church or State require, and is a very
different thing from seizing poor women possessed by diabolic
delusions, or on the malicious accusations or foolish suspicions of
the ignorant vulgar, and casting them into horrible dungeons,
whence they are dragged to be torn and crushed by every imaginable
instrument of torture, till, however guiltless they are, they
confess to sorcery, since it is better to give their souls to God in
innocence, even through flame, than longer endure the hideous
torments of bloodthirsty tyrants. And should they die under
torture or in prison, the accusers and judges cry out triumphantly
that they have committed suicide, or that the devil has broken
their necks.</p>

<p>Here follows a burst of indignant eloquence which would have
cost Weyer dear had he fallen into the clutches of the witch-​hunters,
and which may be given in the terse vigour of the original:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Sed ubi tandem is apparuerit quem nihil latet, Scrutator
cordium et renum, ipsius abstrusissimae etiam veritatis Cognitor
et Iudex, vestri actus palam fient, O vos praefracti tyranni, O
iudices sanguinarii, hominem exuti et caecitate ab omni misericordia
procul remoti. Ad ipsius extremi iudicii tribunal iustissimum
vos provoco, qui inter vos et me decernet ubi sepulta et
culcata Veritas resurget vobisque in faciem resistet latrociniorum
ultionem <span class="nowrap">exactura.’<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></span></p></div>

<p>Their credulity almost equals their cruelty, as shown by the
belief that a certain old woman caused the excessive cold of the
preceding winter, and by the absurd swimming test. What effect
can denial of faith, evil intentions, or a corrupt fantasy have upon
a person’s specific gravity, on which floating depends? Moreover,
women usually float, since their specific gravity is less than that of
men, as Hippocrates pointed <span class="nowrap">out.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></span> But nothing is too absurd for
a witch inquisitor. Some fishermen at Rotterdam drew up their
nets full of stones but fishless. This was clearly witchcraft, so they
seized an unfortunate woman who confessed in her terror that she
had flown out of the window through a hole the size of a finger-end,
dived under the sea in a <span class="nowrap">mussel-shell,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></span> and there terrified the fishes<span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
and put stones in the nets. The woman, says Weyer, was evidently
mad or deluded by the devil, but they burnt her all the same.
Treachery and cruelty go together. A priest, having failed to
make a witch confess, promised that if she would admit some small
act of sorcery, he would see that she was released after some slight
penance. Thereupon she confessed and was burnt <span class="nowrap">alive.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></span></p>

<p>In contrast to this, Weyer describes the method of dealing with
witchcraft in the duchy of Cleves. In 1563 a farmer, finding his
cows gave less milk than usual, consulted a witch-​finder, who told
him that one of his own daughters had bewitched them. The girl,
deluded by the devil, admitted this and accused sixteen other
women of being her accomplices. The magistrate wrote to the
duke proposing to imprison them all, but the latter, probably at
Weyer’s instigation, replied that the witch-​finder was to be imprisoned,
the girl to be instructed by a priest and warned against
the delusions of demons, and the sixteen women in no way to be
<span class="nowrap">molested.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></span></p>

<p>An old woman of eighty was arrested at Mons on charge of
witchcraft, the chief evidence being that her mother had long ago
been tortured to death on a similar charge. To make her confess
they poured boiling oil over her legs, which produced blisters and
ulcers, and her son hearing of it sent her a roll of lint to put round
them. This was supposed to make magic bandages by the aid of
which the woman might escape, and the son was promptly arrested.
The mother was to be burnt in a few days, and her son would probably
have followed, when Weyer, by permission of the Duke of
Cleves, visited Count William of Mons and explained his views on
witchcraft. He also examined the old woman, who was so broken
down that she fainted several times, and finally obtained the release
of <span class="nowrap">both.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></span></p>

<p>Theologians (says Weyer in conclusion) may object that he is
only a physician and bid him keep to his last. He can only reply
that St. Luke was a physician, and that he is one of those who hope
by the mercy of God and grace of Christ to attain that royal priesthood
of which St. Paul and St. John speak. Finally he is ready to
submit all he has said to the judgement of the Church, and to recant
any errors of which he may be convicted.</p>

<p>The Church answered by putting his name on the <i>Index</i>
as an <i>auctor primae classis</i>, that is, one whose opinions are so<span class="pagenum" title="221"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>
dangerous that none of his works may be read by the faithful
without special permission, while his book was solemnly burnt
by the Protestant University of <span class="nowrap">Marburg.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></span> The Duke of Alva,
then engaged in his notorious work in the Netherlands, used his
influence to get Weyer removed from his position at the court
of Cleves. In this he was aided by the duke’s increasing melancholia
and ill health, which were considered by many a judgement
upon him for his protection of Weyer and neglect of witch-​burning.
In 1578 Weyer resigned his post to his son Galen, and in
1581 witch-​hunting commenced in the duchy of Cleves. Weyer,
however, as befitted the chivalrous defender of outraged womanhood,
enjoyed the friendship and protection of Countess Anna of
Techlenburg, at whose residence he died, 1588, aged seventy-two.</p>

<p>The work on <i>The Deceptions of Demons</i> has been aptly compared
to a torch thrown out into the darkness, which for a moment
brightly illumes a small space and then disappears. It made
a temporary sensation, and was welcomed by a few of the more
enlightened spirits of the time; it saved the lives of some unfortunate
women (being successfully quoted the very year after
publication in defence of a young woman at Frankfort, who confessed
she had flown through the air and had intercourse with
the devil), and it marks the beginning of an open and persistent
opposition to the witch mania. Spee also has a curious story
showing the influence of Weyer’s book:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘A great prince invited two priests to his table, both men of
learning and piety. He asked one of them whether he thought
it right to arrest and torture persons on the evidence of 10 or
12 witches. Might not the devil have deceived them in order
to make rulers shed innocent blood, as certain learned men had
lately argued, “thereby causing us pangs of conscience”? The
priest stoutly maintained that these pangs were needless, for God
would never allow the devil to bring innocent men to a shameful
and horrible death in this way; and so he (the prince) might
continue the witch trials as usual. He persisted in this, till the
prince said, “I am sorry, my father, you have condemned yourself
and cannot complain were I to order your immediate arrest,
for no less than 15 persons have sworn you were with them at
the witch dances”, and he produced the records of their trials in
proof. Then the good man stood like butter in the sun in the
dog-days, and had nothing more to say for <span class="nowrap">himself.’<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="222"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span></p>
<p>But it had little effect on the superstition itself, which reached
its height during the following half-​century; and the author is
compelled by his religious beliefs to admit so much that his position
is hardly tenable. Indeed, his premisses had already been granted
by the witch-​hunters themselves. The jurist Molitor, for instance,
admits that much witchcraft is imaginary and due to the deceptions
of demons, but while the physician argues that these
deceptions are rendered possible by disease, and are themselves
largely of the nature of disease, so that the victims deserve pity
and medical treatment rather than burning, the lawyer asserts
that a person can only be so deceived by his free will, and therefore
a woman who believes she has made a compact or had intercourse
with the devil is as deserving of punishment as if she had
actually done <span class="nowrap">so.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></span></p>

<p>Just over a century after the appearance of Weyer’s book
(1664)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Sir Thomas Brown of Norwich, the famous physician of his
time, was desired by my Lord Chief Baron [Hale] to give his
judgement [in a case of witchcraft]. And he declared that he was
clearly of opinion That the Fits were natural, but heightened by
the devil co-operating with the malice of the witches at whose
instance he did the villanies. And he added, That in Denmark
there had been lately a great Discovery of Witches, who used the
very same way of afflicting persons by conveying pins into them.’</p></div>

<p>The jury ‘having Sir Thomas Brown’s Declaration about
Denmark for their encouragement, in half an hour brought them
in guilty<span class="ell">...</span>. They were hanged maintaining their <span class="nowrap">innocence.’<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></span></p>

<p>Had Brown been better acquainted with <i>The Deceptions of
Demons</i> he might have hesitated to make that ‘Declaration about
Denmark’, but Weyer’s early opponent, Bishop Binsfeld, has no
difficulties. Quoting Origen (in Matt. xvii. 15) he exclaims,
‘Physicians may say what they like, we who believe the Gospel
hold that devils cause lunacy’ and many other <span class="nowrap">diseases.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></span> But
for a demon to cause disease or do other harm, two things are
requisite, the permission of God and the free will of some malicious
person, witch, or sorcerer. The physician, Weyer, has denied the
possibility of a compact with the devil, but is easily refuted by<span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
Scripture and Church authority. Did not the devil try to make
a compact with Christ <span class="nowrap">Himself?<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span> Similarly he has no difficulty
in showing that the Hebrew word for witch means much more
than ‘poisoner’, and, given the almost universal beliefs of the
age, it must be admitted that Brown and the bishop have the best
of the argument.</p>

<p>In the opening chapter of his well-known work on rationalism,
Lecky says that the decline of the belief in witchcraft ‘presents
a spectacle not of argument and conflict, but of silent evanescence
and decay’; it was ‘unargumentative and insensible’. Scot’s
work ‘exercised no appreciable influence’, and, so far as the
result was concerned, he, Weyer, and their like might as well
have kept quiet and waited for the change to be effected by
‘what is called the spirit of the age’, that is, ‘a gradual insensible
yet profound modification of the habits of thought’ due to
‘the progress of civilization’. This theory has been ably criticized
<span class="nowrap">elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></span> The truth it contains seems to be that argument
would not have sufficed to change public opinion about witchcraft,
without the aid of changes in other matters, and especially the
development and success of scientific investigation. Such discoveries
as the motion of the earth and circulation of the blood,
when generally accepted (which was not till late in the seventeenth
century), showed that the learned as well as the vulgar might be
utterly mistaken in important beliefs supported by apparently
good evidence, and that scientific methods of attaining truth
differed widely from those of the witch-​hunters.</p>

<p>The progress of civilization by practically abolishing the use
of torture would alone have immensely diminished the number
of victims, and of those ‘confessions’ on which the belief was
fed. To use military language, the witch mania was an ugly and
formidable redoubt connected with other forts and entrenchments.
It suffered somewhat from the bombardment by Weyer and
Scot, but could only be finally demolished by a general advance
of the forces of science and civilization. But if every one had
trusted to ‘the spirit of the age’ rather than disturb his neighbours’
beliefs, we might still be burning our grandmothers.</p>

<p>Though born in what is now Holland and educated in France,
German writers claim Weyer as their countryman and compare<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
him with Martin Luther. The monk of Wittenberg is indeed a fine
figure with his ‘Here stand I; I cannot otherwise, God help me!’
But he had half Germany behind him; both princes and populace
were ready to protect him. Weyer stood practically alone, and if
he escaped being burnt by jurists and theologians, had a fair
chance of being lynched by an enraged mob as a sorcerer and
protector of witches. There was little to save him from torture
and death but the strength of mind of Duke William of Cleves,
who came of an insane family and already showed signs of
melancholia.</p>

<p>Weyer was happily spared such a trial of his fortitude, but
none the less does he deserve our admiration as the chivalrous
champion of womanhood, who first, with vizor up and lance in
rest, greeted, alas! not, like the knights of legend, by prayers and
blessings but by threats and imprecations, went forth to do open
battle with the hideous monster which had so long tortured and
slain the innocent and helpless.</p>

<h2 class="mt2em">THE ‘TRACTATUS DE CAUSIS ET INDICIIS
MORBORUM’</h2>

<p class="tac fs120">كتاب الاسباب والعلامات</p>

<p class="tac">ATTRIBUTED TO MAIMONIDES</p>

<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">By Reuben Levy</span></p>


<p>Among modern authorities on Arabian medicine, the opinion
has been widely held that the position of Maimonides as a
medical writer must depend mainly upon an unpublished work
from his hand, known as the <i>Tractatus de Causis et Indiciis
Morborum</i><span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></span> It is here sought to demonstrate that the Bodleian
MS. (Marsh 379), hitherto regarded as containing this work,
is in reality by another author, while the Paris MS. (Bibliothèque
Nationale, Ancien Fonds <span class="nowrap">411),<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></span> the only other alleged
copy of the <i>Tractatus de Causis et Indiciis Morborum</i>, contains
in fact no such work. Moreover, evidence will be adduced showing
that it is not probable that Maimonides composed a treatise of
this scope.</p>

<p>For their information concerning the <i>Tractatus</i>, the modern
bibliographers evidently rely entirely on entries in the catalogues
of the respective libraries. The 1739 Catalogue of Arabic and
Hebrew MSS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale contains the following
<span class="nowrap">entry:<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></span> ‘Codex bombycinus, Aleppo in bibliothecam Colbertinam
anno 1673 illatus, quo continetur R. Mosis Maemonidae
de morborum causis et illorum curatione tractatus, Arabice,
charactere Hebraico.’ Careful examination of the manuscript
disclosed the fact that it contained no fewer than four works of<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
Maimonides, viz. on <span class="nowrap">Poisons,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></span> on <span class="nowrap">Asthma,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></span> the <i>Tractatus de Regimine
Sanitatis</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></span> and the <i>Tractatus de Morbo Regis Aegypti</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></span> all
bound together in <span class="nowrap">confusion.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></span> All these are known to be by
Maimonides, and there is nothing besides them in the volume.</p>

<p>There has always been a good deal of confusion about the
works <i>de Regimine Sanitatis</i> and <i>de Morbo Regis Aegypti</i>. The
former is variously known as <i>de Regimine Sanitatis, de Cibo et
Alimento, de Dietetica</i>, ‘the letter to the Sultan’, or as ‘the Consultation
concerning (the Sultan) Al <span class="nowrap">Afḍal’.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></span> The latter also has
a number of titles, such as <i>de Causis <span class="nowrap">Accidentium,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></span> de Morborum
Causis et Curatione</i>, and <i>Responsum ad Regem Raqqa</i>, in addition
to its title of <i>de Morbo Regis Aegypti</i>. In 1514, in Venice the two
treatises were printed together in Latin as one <span class="nowrap">work.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></span></p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Leclerc<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></span> has made confusion worse confounded by saying that
‘ce que l’on a désigné sous les titres, <i>De Morbo Regis Aegypti,
De Causis Accidentium, De Causis et Indiciis Morborum, De Cibo
et Alimento</i>, ne sont autre chose que tout ou partie du même
<span class="nowrap">ouvrage’.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></span> No doubt he was led into making this statement<span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>
partly by the fact that <span class="nowrap">Wüstenfeld<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></span> gives the title of <i>de Causis
et Indiciis Morborum</i> both to the Bibliothèque Nationale MS.
(which Leclerc knew as <i>de Causis Accidentium</i>) and to the
Bodley MS.</p>

<p>The entry concerning the latter in Uri’s Bodleian Catalogue
of <span class="nowrap">1787<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></span> reads as follows:</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it is no such thing. This title, together

to him, Muhaḏḏib ed Din was born at Bagdad in <span class="lowercase smcap">A.H.</span> 515
(= <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1121), and after studying medicine and philosophy settled
at Mosul. Later he became the physician of the Shah Arman,
chieftain of Khalāt on Lake Van in Armenia, in whose service
he amassed great wealth. He completed the <i>Delectus</i> at Mosul
in the year <span class="lowercase smcap">A.H.</span> 560 (= <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1164), and died there in <span class="lowercase smcap">A.H.</span> 610
(= <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> 1213), with the reputation of being first physician of his
time.</p>

<p>Another fragment of the same work of Muhaḏḏib ed Din,
which includes most of the contents of the Bodleian MS., besides
a good deal of material which has been lost from the latter, exists
in the British <span class="nowrap">Museum.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></span> The Leyden Library contains a unique
copy of the work in three books. This is claimed to be complete by
the Catalogue of the <span class="nowrap">library,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></span> although Bar Hebraeus [1226–1286]&mdash;Catholicus

treat (i) of generalities (i.e. Anatomy, Physiology, and the general
causes of disease), (ii) of medicaments, and (iii) of particular
diseases and their treatment.</p>

<p>The Bodleian and British Museum MSS. contain part of the
third book, which was probably in general use by itself as a dictionary
of medicine. The British Museum copy has only lost the
earlier chapters of this third part, but the Bodleian MS., although
possessing a few more chapters at the beginning, is far less complete
in the other <span class="nowrap">portions.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></span></p>

<p>Wüstenfeld and the bibliographers that followed him have<span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span>
evidently derived their information concerning these MSS. from
the catalogues of the Bodleian Library and of the Bibliothèque
Nationale. No mediaeval bibliographer has up to the present been
found who mentions this book of <span class="nowrap">Maimonides.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></span> Wüstenfeld’s
usual authority for his statements is the great thirteenth-​century
medical biographer, Ibn Abi ‘Uṣaibia. But, though the latter
gives a life of the Hebrew physician and a list of his <span class="nowrap">writings,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></span> he
makes no mention of the <i>Tractatus de Causis et Indiciis Morborum</i>.
Moreover, this <i>Tractatus</i> has no place in Haji Khalfa’s admirable
bibliography of Arabic works, which contains notices of four
books bearing the title <i>De Causis et Indiciis Morborum</i>, not one
of which is by Maimonides. Lastly, neither the historian Al
Qifty in his <i>Classes philosophorum et astronomorum et medicorum</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></span>
nor Bar Hebraeus, who is said to have plagiarized <span class="nowrap">him,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></span> notice
the work in their sketches of the physician’s life.</p>

<p>The Bodleian MS. alleged to contain the <i>Tractatus</i> is one of
a collection of over seven hundred volumes bequeathed to the
library on his death, November 2, 1713, by Narcissus Marsh,
Archbishop successively of Cashel, Dublin, and Armagh. Most of
his Oriental MSS. had been procured for him either in the East
by Robert Huntington, Bishop of Raphoe and chaplain to the
English merchants at Aleppo, or at the sale of Golius’s library
at Leyden in October <span class="nowrap">1696.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></span> Golius was a Dutch orientalist,
born at Leyden in 1596. He studied medicine and Oriental
languages at the University of Leyden, and after leaving it he
accompanied a French embassy to Morocco in 1622. He remained
in Morocco for two years, and while there collected various
MSS. On his return in 1624 he was appointed to the Chair of
Arabic at Leyden, but was allowed a period of leave for travel
in the East before taking up his appointment. He took with him
a grant of money for the purchase of MSS., and these to the
number of over two hundred are now deposited in the University<span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>
Library at Leyden. On several occasions during his travels in
Arabia attempts were made by Arab chiefs to detain him for
his medical knowledge, but he returned safely and later wrote
a number of works mainly concerned with Arabic. He died
in 1667.</p>

<p>Among the MSS. which Golius himself procured for the Leyden
Library was that of the <i>Delectus</i>. It is at least unlikely therefore
that such a profound Arabist, who was also a medical man, would
have bought the Bodley fragment for a genuine work of Maimonides;
the primary responsibility for the error thus probably
rests with Huntington. However that may be, it was Uri, in his
catalogue of the Bodleian MSS., who first published the error,
and from him it was passed on to the modern bibliographers.</p>

<p>John Uri was a Hungarian who had studied Oriental literature
under Schultens at Leyden, and was recommended to Archbishop
Secker for the purpose of cataloguing the Bodleian Oriental MSS.,
by Sir Joseph Yorke, then ambassador in the <span class="nowrap">Netherlands.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></span> Many
years were occupied in the preparation of the work, which appears
to have commenced in 1766 and was not completed till 1787. In
spite of the length of time which Uri occupied in his task, his
successor, Pusey, found sufficient errors in it to fill sixty closely
printed pages. In his preface to the second volume of the
Catalogue, issued in <span class="nowrap">1835,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></span> Pusey complains ‘Urius vero MSS.
haud raro negligenter exscripsit’, and says that on re-examination
of Uri’s work he discovered, ‘besides the errors which Uri
himself would have admitted, that nearly all the purchasers of
these books, Pocock alone excepted, had had spurious works
foisted on them by wily Orientals. He therefore looked through
all the books which Uri had enumerated, excepting the more
common ones, to see if they corresponded to their titles or not.
By doing this he discovered various irregularities. In some cases
the titles had been covered over with paper or obliterated with
ink, or practically erased with a knife. In others, by slight changes
in the authors’ names, more famous people were indicated as
responsible for the works. Lastly, by changing the pagination
in some of the volumes fragments were represented as complete<span class="pagenum" title="231"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span>
works, and a few pages of one work were even occasionally sewn
on at the beginning of <span class="nowrap">another.’<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></span></p>

<p>Uri’s errors will be the more readily condoned when it is
remembered that he did not specialize on the Arabic MSS. alone,
and that his work seeks to catalogue, <i>for the first time</i>, a two
hundred years’ accumulation of Oriental MSS., including Hebrew,
Aramaic, Syriac, Aethiopic, Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Coptic
writings. Nevertheless, Uri’s entry with reference to the present
MS. deserves some of Pusey’s criticism. The MS. has three
parts, each written in a different hand, the first and most important
part being the supposed <i>Tractatus de Causis et Indiciis Morborum</i>,
which covers folios 2–87. The second part is a fragment of some
as yet unidentified medical work (folios 88–115); and the third,
consisting of the first and last folios, gives us an introduction and
an end piece to the first part.</p>

<h2 class="mt2em">SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY AND LOGICAL PROOF</h2>

<p class="tac">By <span class="smcap">F. C. S. Schiller</span></p>


<p>§ 1. Among the obstacles to scientific progress a high place
must certainly be assigned to the analysis of scientific procedure
which Logic has provided. This analysis has not only been
inadequate in itself, but has set itself a mistaken aim. It has not
tried to describe the methods by which the sciences have actually
advanced, and to extract from their experience the logical rules
which might be used to regulate scientific progress, but has treated
scientific discoveries almost entirely as illustrations of a preconceived
ideal of proof, and so has freely rearranged the actual
procedure in accordance with its prejudices. For the order of
discovery there has been substituted an order of ‘proof’, and this
substitution has been justified by the assumption that if discovery
had taken the ideally best course, it would have coincided with
the process of proof. It followed, of course, that the same logic
would do for both, and that this logic was already in existence.</p>

<p>The damage thus inflicted upon Science was twofold. Not only
were the logicians given a plausible excuse for persisting in their
profound misapprehension of scientific inquiry and rendered incapable
of giving any help or guidance in the solution of actual
problems, but, what was much worse, the scientists themselves
were misled about the nature of their operations.</p>

<p>The precise value of the service which a correct logical analysis
of its procedure might have rendered to Science is perhaps open
to dispute, though it must surely be beneficial to operate consciously,
and with a full understanding of their nature, the methods
which have been hit upon empirically; but even if logicians have
commonly been too unfamiliar with the details of scientific problems
to offer much practical advice, it would be difficult to overrate the
mischiefs which must have resulted from referring scientists to an
incorrect analysis of their actual procedures. For the attempt to
justify by such a false ideal what they had actually done was
bound to divert their attention from the methods that were
actually effective and fruitful to others which were impracticable<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
and sterile, to waste energy upon false aims and impossible ideals,
and so to hamper scientists fatally in the exercise of their scientific
rights and powers.</p>

<p>Hence it is not too much to say that the more deference men
of science have paid to Logic, the worse it has been for the scientific
value of their reasoning, while the less they have troubled to know
about the theory of Science, the better it has been for their practice.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the world, however, the great men of science
have usually been kept in salutary ignorance of the logical tradition
and left to their own devices, by the accident that the historical
organization of academic studies nearly everywhere confined ‘logic’
to the literary curriculum. Nevertheless, the moral of this situation
is not that it is right for science to neglect logic and for logic to
despise science, but that science should appeal from logic as it is
to logic as it ought to be, and should insist on being provided with
a <i>reformed</i> logic. For surely if a scientific education is to be more
than a narrow and technical specialty, and is to exert a ‘liberalizing’
and broadening effect on the mind, it <i>ought</i> to include a study
of scientific method in its generality and a certain understanding
of the intellectual instruments by which all others are operated
and constructed.</p>

<p>The whole evidence for these contentions it will not, of course,
be possible to marshal within the limits of this essay, but the
systematic criticism to which the whole traditional logic has been
subjected in my <i>Formal</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>Logic</i><a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></span> may perhaps absolve me from the
duty of substantiating them exhaustively. It may suffice to
indicate the extent of the scientific grievance against ‘logic’ by
drawing up a list of problems in the logic of science which the
traditional logic has misconceived, and then to select for fuller
treatment a palmary example of the radical discrepancy between
the two.</p>

<p>The traditional logic may be convicted of having gravely misrepresented,
(1) the value of classification and the formation of
classes, scientific processes of which the real logic was only revealed
by the Darwinian theory, (2) the function of definition, (3) the
importance of analogy, (4) of hypothesis and (5) of fictions, (6) the
incomplete dependence of scientific results on the ‘principles’ by
which they are (apparently) obtained, (7) the formation of scientific
‘law’ and its relation to its ‘cases’, (8) the nature of causal<span class="pagenum" title="237"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
analysis. Other important features of scientific procedure cannot
be said to have been recognized at all, e.g. (9) the problem of
determining what is <i>relevant</i> to an inquiry and what practically
must be, and safely may be, excluded, (10) the methods and
justification of <i>selection</i>, (11) the essentially <i>experimental</i> nature
of all thought and consequent inevitableness of <i>risk</i>, (12) the
necessity of so conceiving ‘truth’ and ‘error’ that it is possible
to <i>discriminate</i> between them, and (13) the need for an inquiry
into <i>meaning</i> and into the conditions of its communication.</p>


<p class="tac mt15em">I</p>

<p>§ 2. The most instructive, however, of the discrepancies between
‘logic’ and scientific procedure will appear if we compare
the logical notion of <i>proof</i> with the scientific process of <i>discovery</i>,
and examine how far it can afford any means of regulating, stimulating,
or even apprehending the latter. We shall find that the
logical theory of ‘proof’ has no bearing on the scientific process
of discovery, is not related to what the sciences call proof, and
can only have a paralysing influence on any scientific activities
which try to model themselves upon it. On the other hand, the
study of the process of discovery will point to an important
correction in the notion of logic.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z3"></a>3. The scientific uselessness of the traditional logic should
not, however, excite surprise. For what reason was there to expect
that the theory of proof should turn out to be adequate, or even
relevant, to scientific procedure? It had sprung from a totally
different interest, proceeded on different assumptions, and aimed
at different ends. It did not spring from interest in the exploration
of nature, and did not aim at its prediction and control. Nor did
it presuppose an incomplete system of knowledge which it was
desired to extend and improve. It originated in a very special
context, from the social need of regulating the practice of dialectical
debate in the Greek schools, assemblies, and law-courts.
It was necessary to draw up rules for determining which side had
won, and which of the points that had been scored were good.</p>

<p>These were the aims Greek logic set itself, and successfully
achieved. But the impress of this origin remains stamped all
over it, and the accounts given of logical proof ever since have
retained essential features of Greek dialectics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span></p>

<p>Thus it was assumed that science could start from principles,
as indisputable as are the current meanings of words in a dialectical
debate, and the end of the whole theory of proof was always conceived
as being to secure the conviction (ἔλεγχος) of one party to
a dispute, who was to be definitely crushed by the triumphant
cogency of a syllogistic demonstration, while the more real and
fruitful analogy between scientific inquiry and debate, viz. that
<i>there is always another side</i>, to which also it is well to listen, was
unfortunately obscured by Aristotle’s discovery of the syllogistic
form and its show of conclusiveness. But for the purpose of
apprehending scientific procedure the syllogism is a snare: by
putting scientific reasoning into syllogisms, the difference between
the true and the false views is made to appear qualitative and
absolute, instead of being a quantitative question of more or less
of scientific value. Thus dogmatism is fostered at the expense of
progressiveness, and the mistake is committed of approaching the
discovery of truth in a party spirit. Hence its dialectical origin
has become <i>fons et origo malorum</i> for logic.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z4"></a>4. It is true that this mistake is very old, and has grown
deeply into the fabric of logic. For Aristotle had no sooner worked
out the classic formulation of the rules of dialectical proof than
he proceeded to extend their scope by applying them to the theory
of science, in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>. His instinct in so doing was
sound enough; for there is no better verification of a theory than
its capacity to bear extension to analogous cases. And of course
if this extension had been successful, it would have supported the
belief that the theory of discovery could profitably be amalgamated
with that of proof.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the verification only seemed to be
successful. Aristotle chose to exemplify his theory of scientific
proof from the mathematical sciences. His choice was natural
enough, because they were the only sciences which had reached
any considerable development in his day, and they had, moreover,
an apparent necessity and universality and a fascinating appearance
of exactness. But he had unwittingly chosen the most difficult
and deceptive exemplification of scientific procedure. Because
the mathematical sciences were in a relatively advanced condition
they seemed to lend themselves to his design. He could there
find terms whose meaning, and principles whose truth, was no
longer in dispute. They could in consequence be argued from<span class="pagenum" title="239"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
with as much assurance as debaters could assume the recognized
meanings of words. And the fact that results seemed to follow
from mathematical definitions and premisses which were not merely
verbal, shed a delusive glory on the forms of dialectical proof by
which they had been reached. Hence it easily escaped notice that
the logical superiority of mathematics was an achievement, not
a datum. Just because the mathematical sciences were very
ancient, their origins had been forgotten, and with them the
tentative gropings which had first selected, and subsequently confirmed,
their principles. They had become immediately certain
and ‘self-​evident’, and no one was disposed to dispute them. On
this psychological fact the whole theory of logical proof was
erected.</p>

<p>Again, it was natural to suppose that the true nature of
scientific knowing must be revealed in its most perfect specimens:
no one stopped to reflect that even so the real difficulties of making
a science are more keenly felt and more easily seen in the nascent
stage than in one which has victoriously overcome them, and has
rewritten its history in the assurance of its prosperous issue.</p>

<p>Lastly, the subtle ambiguity which pervades all mathematical
reasoning, according as its terms are taken as <i>pure</i> or as applied,
was overlooked entirely&mdash;with the disastrous result that the universality,
certainty, and exactness pertaining (hypothetically) to
the ideal creations of ‘pure’ mathematics were erroneously transferred
to their ‘applied’ counterparts. To this day logicians are
found to argue that real space is homogeneous because it is convenient
in Euclidean geometry to abstract from the multitudinous
deformations to which bodies moving through it are
subjected, and to leave them to be treated by <span class="nowrap">physics;<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></span> nor are
they aware of any lack of ‘exactness’ and discrimination when they
identify the ideal triangle with the figures they draw on the blackboard.</p>

<p>§ 5. After its apparent success in analysing mathematical procedure
there was no more disputing the supremacy of the theory of
‘proof’. The facts that its field of application was soon found to be
much narrower than that of science, and that it failed egregiously
to apply to the procedures of the (openly) empirical sciences, and
<i>a fortiori</i> could not justify them, if they were noticed at all, were
held merely to show that these sciences stood on a low level of<span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span>
thought, which from the loftier standpoint of logic could be contemplated
only with contempt; if they required help and got
none, so much the worse for them. Accordingly the whole theory
of science was so interpreted, and the whole of logic was so constructed,
as to lead up to the ideal of demonstrative science,
which in its turn rested on a false analogy which assimilated it
to the dialectics of ‘proof’. Does not this mistake go far to
account for the neglect of experience and the unprogressiveness
of science for nearly 2,000 years after Aristotle?</p>

<p>§ 6. Yet the deplorable consequences of this error should not
render us unjust. The influence of Aristotelian logic on the theory
of science was natural, and in a sense deserved. For Aristotelian
logic is perhaps the mightiest discovery any man has achieved
single-​handed. Its might is sufficiently attested by the length of
its reign. Euclidean geometry alone is comparable with it, and
Euclid owed far more to his predecessors than Aristotle. Moreover,
the Aristotelian logic may be said to have achieved its
purpose. It was able to regulate dialectical discussion. The
syllogism did determine whether a disputant had proved his case,
and for any one who had accepted its assumptions its decision
was final, while even its severest critics had to admit that it
was an indisputable fact, the interpretation of which was a real
problem.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is not yet any agreement among logicians
about the solution of this problem. Aristotle’s own analysis did
not go back far enough: he stopped short at the <i>Dictum de Omni</i>
and the reduction of syllogisms in the second and third figures to
the first. He did not penetrate to the ultimate assumptions which
were implied in the dialectical purpose and social function of the
syllogism. But the truth is that syllogistic reasoning presupposes
quite a number of conventions which Aristotle did not state, and
which can hardly be said to have been adequately recognized
since.</p>

<p>§ 7. (1) The first of these may be called the <i>Fixity of Terms</i>.
Syllogistic reasoning manifestly depends on the assumption that
the terms occurring in it have meanings sufficiently stable to stand
transplantation from one context to another; for only so can they
establish connexions between one context and another. Thus
a syllogism in <i>Barbara</i> argues that because <i>all M is P</i> and <i>all S
is M, all S must be P</i>. But it can do this ‘validly’ only if <span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span><i>M</i>, its
middle term, remains immutably itself, and is the same in both
premisses. Doubt, dispute, or confute this assumption, and the
cogency of the syllogism as a form of ‘proof’ is overthrown at
once. If the sense in which <i>M is P</i> is not the same as that in which
<i>S is M</i>, the syllogism breaks in two, and its conclusion becomes
precarious. Raise the question of how far reality conforms to
this assumption, and you get at once a subtle problem of the
applicability of the syllogistic form to the case in hand, which is
precisely analogous to the question whether a theorem of pure
mathematics is applicable to the behaviour of a real thing. In
either case the cogency of the ‘proof’ which establishes the conclusion
is impaired and ceases to be unconditional. The conclusion
of a ‘valid’ syllogism will only follow <i>if</i> the middle term can be
known to be unambiguous, and if the objects designated by the
terms do not change rapidly enough to defeat the inference. And
that this is the case can usually be ascertained only by actual
experience. The conclusion, therefore, cannot be simply deduced;
it has actually to <i>come true</i>, before we can be sure that the reasoning
<i>was</i> sound. Absolutely <i>a priori</i> proof thus becomes impossible,
if the assumption of the fixity of terms is contested: all proof
becomes, in a sense, empirical.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, experience shows that the fixity of terms, though
not a ‘fact’, is <i>a valid ‘fiction’</i>: in ordinary discussion the terms
may usually be taken as fixed enough to render valid syllogisms
common. An ordinary debate proceeds upon the assumption that
the meaning of the terms involved is fixed, and cannot be varied
arbitrarily. To science, however, this assumption does not apply
without restriction. In a progressive science the meaning of terms
often develops so rapidly that such verbal reasoning does <i>not</i>
suffice. Hence the mere occurrence of verbal contradictions in
a scientific reasoning is no proof that the argument is unsound.
It may show merely that its terms are <i>growing</i>.</p>

<p>It should be observed further that this same assumption is
implied in the fundamental ‘laws of thought’ on which the
traditional logic rests. Indeed, the notorious ‘Law of Identity’
seems to be merely another statement of it. It is usually formulated
as ‘<i>A is A</i>’, but in its actual logical use it is really the
assumption that ‘everything <i>is</i> what it is called’. It is, of course,
anything but self-​evident that ‘<i>A</i>’ <i>is A</i>, but <i>unless</i> the <i>S</i>, <i>M</i>,
and <span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span><i>P</i> of the syllogism are <i>rightly</i> so called, the syllogism will not
hold. Similarly, the Law of Contradiction collapses at once if the
terms to which it is applied are allowed to change. The inability
of ‘<i>A</i>’ both to be <i>B</i> and not to be <i>B</i> vanishes if ‘<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span><i>A</i>’ is not fixed
and may change its habits. And of course the real things known
to science all change, and are fixed only by a fiction. Hence every
application of the logical convention to real things may be challenged:
it involves a fiction and takes a risk, and both of these
may be bad. But the traditional logic ignores both the risk and
the fiction and the lack of cogency in its attitude.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z8"></a>8. (2) It is a further presupposition of the syllogism that the
meaning of its terms is <i>known</i>. When a discussion is begun the
parties to it are supposed to understand each other, and not to
have first to find out and form the meaning of the terms they use.
This assumption also is roughly true in ordinary debate, and its
convenience is manifest. If things are rightly named, and if this
feat has been accomplished once for all&mdash;presumably by Adam
and Eve before they were turned out of Paradise for trying to
know too much&mdash;we shall escape many of the most trying difficulties
of scientific inquiry. We need no longer trouble whether
the best names have been given, and whether a name good for
one purpose is equally good for another, nor need we inquire
whether our names may not unite what is alien on account of
a superficial likeness, or separate what is akin on account of a
superficial difference.</p>

<p>In science, on the other hand, the assumption that we know what
meanings our terms can convey is not made as a matter of course.
We may begin with roughly labelling objects of interest, and then
inquiries may be conducted into, e.g., ‘electricity’, ‘elements’,
‘life’, ‘species’, &amp;c., in the hope of settling what these terms <i>shall</i>
mean, and of finding out <i>more</i> about their meaning, and without
making the assumption that whatever new facts are discovered
about them must conform to our preconceptions and confirm our
nomenclature. Thus to a man of science it will not be cogent to
argue that because an ‘element’ is (by definition) an ultimate
form of matter which cannot be broken up, and ‘radium’ breaks
up, ‘radium’ is not an ‘element’, or that because ‘species’ are
eternal forms, and the Darwinian theory claims that they are not
immutable, it can be dismissed as involving the ‘contradiction’
that a ‘species’ is not a species. Thus the best syllogisms lose
their cogency so soon as a question is raised whether the verbal
identity of their terms is an adequate guarantee of the real identity
of the things they are applied to.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z9"></a>9. (3) It is a further presupposition of the logician’s conception
of ‘proof’ that absolute truths exist, and that in the
ideal demonstration they form the premisses from which the conclusion
follows. This presupposition is not stated, and is not
implied in the form of the syllogism. For a syllogism is no less
‘valid’ if its premisses are true only hypothetically, and not
absolutely. Indeed, it is not thought to impair the ‘validity’ of
a syllogism that its premisses should be utterly false. At any
rate we can <i>reason</i> quite as well with hypotheses and probabilities
as with absolute truths, and this is in fact what we usually do,
whether or not we are aware that our premisses are conditional
and hypothetical. This ordinary practice, however, is resented by
the traditional logic. For if our premisses are only hypothetically
true, how can they lead to conclusions which can be declared
absolutely true? And if our conclusions are not absolutely true,
how can they be certain? Are they not bound to remain infected
with the doubts which beset their <span class="nowrap">premisses?<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></span> As we value the
certainty of our conclusions, therefore, absolutely true and certain
premisses must be procured. If they cannot be procured, even
the best formal proofs will remain hypothetical, and all truth will
become dependent on experience. For if nothing is true absolutely,
and every truth has originated humbly in a guess that has
grown into a successful hypothesis, it can always be suggested
that after all it may benefit by a little more verification. It may
be true enough psychologically and for practical purposes, but it
does not realize the ideal of ‘logical certainty’.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z10"></a>10. This ideal Logic has formulated from the first. Aristotle
already was not content with merely analysing the form of reasoning;
he aspired to formulate the norm of scientific demonstration.
The ‘demonstrative syllogism’, which he held to be the form of
truly scientific reasoning, differs from the formal syllogism in two
essential respects. Its premisses are absolutely true, and its middle
term states the real ‘cause’, which connects its terms and is not
merely a <i>ratio cognoscendi</i>. The reasoning proceeds, therefore,
from premisses which are unambiguous, true, and certain, i.e.
<i>necessarily</i> true and <i>absolutely</i> certain. Nor does the conclusion
lose any of this excellence. Logic puts on a fine air of modesty,<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
and merely claims that the syllogistic form is a guarantee that
no truth can be <i>lost</i> on the way from the premisses to the conclusion
in a ‘valid’ argument. If, therefore, our thought is
properly arranged, our conclusion will be as true and certain as
were its premisses, and no man will be able to gainsay it. It is
the great beauty and merit of the syllogistic form that it is an
arrangement which gives us this guarantee.</p>

<p>It was natural, therefore, that throughout the history of logic
enormous importance should be attached to the acquisition of
unquestionable starting-​points. For the possession of ‘valid
forms’ was not enough. It only insured against loss of truth,
it did not provide for its acquisition. It seemed, however, to
imply that truth could only be generated out of truth, and handed
down from the premisses to the conclusion. Hence the insistent
demand for assured starting-​points, self-​evident ‘principles’,
which the infallible method of syllogistic deduction might conduct
to equally certain conclusions.</p>

<p>In reality, however, this demand for certainty was extra-​logical:
it is not required for the purpose of analysing reasoning.
For it is just as easy to reason from doubtful and probable premisses
as from certainties, nor need the doubt in the reasoner’s
mind affect the form of the reasoning. If, however, there is an
imperative desire for certainty, it must be somehow gratified by
logic. And there seemed to be no way of doing so except by
ascribing absolute truth and certainty to the initial principles of
science.</p>

<p>Of course it was covertly assumed that certainty could only
be reached by <i>starting</i> from certainty, and that no possibility of
a growth of assurance in the progress of the reasoning could be
entertained. In a sense this assumption was correct (cf.&nbsp;<a href="#z27">§§ 27</a>, <a href="#z28">28</a>),
because it is true that the gradual verification of scientific truths
does not render them absolute; but it led to neglect of all methods
which appeared to start with premisses initially doubtful and
hardening into certainties by gradual confirmation. No doubt it
was not strictly impossible to reason from premisses not known
to be true, but such reasoning was despised as ‘dialectical’, and
no inquiry was made into the frequency of its occurrence in actual
science. Why, then, waste time upon so unworthy a procedure,
instead of fixing one’s whole attention upon the truly logical
ideal, the absolute proof of absolute truth? Let us maintain,<span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>
rather, the old <span class="nowrap">Aristotelian<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></span> conviction that the truly scientific
syllogism proceeds from premisses that are true and underivative
(because ‘self-​evident’) and inerrant, and demonstrates its conclusion
with ineluctable necessity! Thus the attainment of <i>absolute
truth</i> was unobtrusively smuggled in as the aim of reasoning,
and became an integral feature of the ideal of ‘demonstration’.</p>

<p>§ 11. From the standpoint of the scientific inquirer, however,
this whole theory of proof is open to the gravest objections. He
finds first that it is impracticable, being composed throughout of
counsels of perfection with which he cannot comply, and then
that, even if he could, they would be perfectly useless, and
destructive of his aims.</p>

<p>(1) It strikes him at once that the Fixity of Terms is an obvious
<i>fiction</i>. He will of course be aware, from his scientific experience,
that fictions have their uses and are often indispensable; but he
will know also that not all fictions are useful, and that the adoption
of a fiction has in each case to be justified by its usefulness. Moreover,
it is not so much its immediate and prospective use which
justifies it, though this yields the usual motive for its adoption,
as the ulterior uses ascertained <i>ex post facto</i> by experience.</p>

<p>He will ask, therefore, for evidence that an <i>absolute</i> fixity of
terms is the vital necessity for logic it is declared to be. He will
admit, of course, the familiar arguments for a certain <i>stability</i> of
meanings which have come down from the days of Plato, but he
will suggest that a <i>relative</i> fixity of terms is quite sufficient to
content them. He will point out that in a progressive science
any absolute fixity in its terms is precluded by the very progress
of the science. For the terms in use must somehow manage to
convey the <i>growing</i> knowledge they are employed to ‘fix’. The
term ‘gas’, for example, must not be tied down to the meaning
Van Helmont desired to convey when he invented it; it must
incorporate all that physics has discovered about ‘gases’ ever
since. Similarly, when Darwinism transforms the notion of
‘species’, and the discovery of radio-​activity that of ‘atom’,
these developments of meaning must be recognized as perfectly
proper. To object to these conceptions as modern science uses
them, on the ground that, because to Plato and Aristotle species
were eternal and immutable, a ‘species’ that changes cannot be
truly a species, or that because an ‘atom’ is etymologically<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>
‘indivisible’, it becomes an impossible self-​contradiction when it
is made up out of ‘electrons’, will seem to him to reveal only
the fatuous pedantry of an utterly unscientific mind.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z12"></a>12. (2) If he is acquainted with psychology, he will perceive
also that the fiction of the fixity of terms is subject to a further
restriction. It is not only in science as such&mdash;for all sciences
must be conceived as progressive&mdash;that the fixity of terms cannot
be made absolute: a real fixity is strictly inconceivable for and
in every human mind. For every term that is actually used to
convey a meaning must be held to form part of a <i>new</i> <span class="nowrap">truth,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></span>
i.e. of a truth that was not previously in being. It is not a question
of principle whether the truth is supposed to be new only to the
person to whom it is addressed, or claims to be new to all, i.e. to
science. For no judgement would be made unless it had something
new to <span class="nowrap">say.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></span> Hence <i>every real judgement</i>, as opposed to the
verbal formulas which are called judgements in the logic-books,
<i>more or less modifies the meaning of its terms</i>. If it succeeds in
being a real judgement and a new truth, it establishes a new and
previously unknown relation between its subject and its predicate.
‘<i>S</i>’ is henceforth an <i>S</i>-which-can-have-<i>P</i>-predicated-of-it, and
‘<i>P</i>’ a <i>P</i>-which-can-be-predicated-of-<i>S</i>. Thus both the psychological
associations and the logical associates of <i>S</i> and <i>P</i> are
changed. That logicians should not have noticed so obvious a
fact can be attributed only to their inveterate habit of not using
in their illustrations real judgements intended to cope with actual
problems, but operating with their verbal skeletons, which are
not being used by any one to convey his meaning, and so do not
have any <i>actual</i> meaning.</p>

<p>Clearly, then, no science can interpret the fixity of terms quite
literally. Or rather, it can only interpret it literally&mdash;as a matter
of the literal integrity of the <i>words</i> that <i>may</i> convey a meaning.
But in a scientific inquiry the convention of formal logic must be
reversed; the fixity of terms must be <i>understood</i> not to be absolute,
but to be merely <i>ad hoc</i> and sufficient to convey a definite
meaning, which it is desired to develop. Accordingly it must
always be assumed that the results of an inquiry are to modify
its terms, and that it is permissible, and indeed inevitable, to
develop their meaning, so long as they remain capable of expressing
and conveying the new truth. We must come to every<span class="pagenum" title="247"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>
inquiry with a willingness to learn and to expand our terms. The
Fixity of Terms, as it is tacitly presupposed in the traditional logic,
is a scientific blunder of the gravest kind.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z13"></a>13. (3) To renounce it, however, entails further consequences.
It appears to undermine the whole notion of <i>formal validity</i>. For
if we admit in principle that the meaning of terms depends vitally
on that of the judgement in which they occur, how can we continue
to rely absolutely on the mere verbal identity of its terms
to hold together a syllogism? In any syllogism the middle term,
<i>M</i>, may have one shade of meaning in relation to <i>P</i>, another in
relation to <i>S</i>. It may be quite right to call <i>M P</i> in one connexion,
and to call <i>S M</i> in another; and yet, when the two assertions are
put together, they may lead to a conclusion which is an error or
an absurdity. The man who (in his laboratory) would rightly
declare that ‘all salt is soluble in water’ and (at his dinner table)
as properly hold that ‘all Cerebos is salt’, could not combine these
assertions to draw the conclusion that ‘all Cerebos is soluble in
water’, without finding that the facts confuted his anticipation.</p>

<p>No doubt, when this had happened, he might explain it, <i>ex
post facto</i> (if he knew logic), by alleging a hidden ‘ambiguity of
the middle term’. We need not here discuss whether it is fair to
treat as an inherent ambiguity what is really a juxtaposition of
shades of meaning which were relative to different purposes and
right in their original contexts, thus manufacturing a fallacy by
selecting the premisses: the important thing is that the logician
should be driven to admit that <i>any</i> middle term may become
ambiguous in this way when a syllogism is constructed, and that
this completely stultifies his assumption that the <i>verbal</i> identity
of the middle guarantees the <i>real</i> identity of the objects to which
it <span class="nowrap">refers.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></span> If we call two things, which are and must be different
if they are to be two, both ‘<span class="pagenum" title="248"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span><i>M</i>’, we necessarily take the risk that
the differences are irrelevant for the purpose of our argument.
We may legitimately assume this, but if we do, our hypothesis
has to be confirmed in fact; it is naïve to think that the verbal
identity of the terms is quite enough. If, then, actual identity
cannot be absolutely guaranteed, if there is <i>always</i> a possibility
that the same term when put into a syllogism and used in reasoning
may develop an ambiguity and become effectively two, it
is evident that no amount of formal validity will safeguard the
truth of a conclusion, even when the premisses are in themselves
severally true. The syllogistic form is convicted of <i>losing</i> truth
which it started from, and this is the very thing it boasted it could
never do. Moreover, its coercive ‘cogency’ is exploded: whoever
wishes to deny a ‘valid’ conclusion after admitting its premisses,
has merely to suggest that by putting the premisses together
a fatal ambiguity has been generated in the middle term.</p>

<p>§ 14. (4) The assumption that everything has been named
rightly, and is what it is called, will scarcely commend itself to
the scientific researcher. He will know from much painful experience
that language only embodies the knowledge which has
been acquired up to date, and too often is only a compendium of
popular errors. Hence in any research which really breaks new
ground the existing terminology will always prove inadequate,
and new technical terms have usually to be devised in order to
embody the new knowledge. The reason is obvious. <i>Ex hypothesi</i>
we are inquiring <i>farther</i> into the subject, because our knowledge
is felt to be insufficient. Accordingly the probable defects of the
terminology we are initially forced to use must be borne in mind:
we may expect it to omit what is unknown, to misdescribe and
to classify wrongly what is partially known, putting together what
does not belong together and separating what does, emphasizing
the unimportant and slurring over the important, and generally
failing to provide the mind with words that give it a real apprehension
of the objects under inquiry. Hence the tacit assumption
of Aristotelian logic that the terms reasoned with are fully known,
that adequate notions are already extant, that truth has merely
to be <i>disentangled</i> by a verbal criticism of existing opinions, and
has not to be discovered outright, is false; nor can any argument
from a verbal identity be taken as final.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z15"></a>15. (5) But of all the assumptions lurking in the theory of
proof, the belief that reasoning can and should start from certainty
will seem the falsest and most pernicious to the man of science.
For it means that we are committed to a search for absolutely<span class="pagenum" title="249"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>
certain premisses as a preliminary to every inquiry, and proscribes
consciously hypothetical, i.e. truly experimental, reasoning altogether,
or at least condemns it as incapable of leading to certainty.
This search, however, will either be perfunctory and uncritical,
if it accepts false claims to certainty; or else vain, if it is conscientious.
For every attempt to prove a conclusion absolutely
demands <i>two</i> absolutely true premisses; hence the more we try
to prove, the more we have to prove, and our search grows the
more endless and futile, the longer it is continued. An immutable
basis of absolutely certain truths, therefore, for reasoning to start
from, is nowhere to be found. In no science is it possible to
<i>start</i> with truths that are absolutely certain. In every science
the initial ‘facts’ are doubtful; they are alleged, but not yet
approved. They embody only unsystematic observation and
prescientific experience of the subject, and so are probably the
products of inaccurate observation, bad interpretation, false preconceptions,
and popular superstitions. To acquire any considerable
scientific value, such material has to be thoroughly revised
and refined.</p>

<p>The validity of methods and the certainty of ‘principles’ are
no more assured than the ‘facts’, initially. Every science has to
work out its own appropriate methods experimentally; even if it
borrows methods from another, it has to find out how and how
far they apply to a new subject. Neither does a science acquire
its principles by divine revelation; even if they fell from heaven
ready-​made, it would insist on testing the authenticity of the
revelation. But philosophers have been extremely reluctant to
admit that the certainty of principles is a gradual growth: for
over 2,000 years they have been endeavouring to discover some
way of securing an infallibility to principles which would render
them independent of the working of the sciences which use them.
But if their labours have proved anything, it is that no such way
can be found.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) They have recognized many principles as ‘<i>self-evident</i>’, and
equipped the mind with a variety of ‘faculties’, expressly invented
to enable it to apprehend the ‘self-​evident’ inerrantly. But they
have not been able to agree upon a list of self-​evident <span class="nowrap">principles,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a></span>
nor even to find any truth whose claims to self-​evidence have not<span class="pagenum" title="250"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a></span>
been denied by competent critics. Nor have they been able to
define their notion of ‘self-​evidence’ itself; they cannot discriminate
between the sound ‘logical’ self-​evidence, which they conceived
to guarantee truth, and its merely ‘psychological’ ‘mimic’, which
is certainly much commoner, and becomes more intense and
extensive the more unsound is the mind that ‘apprehends’ <span class="nowrap">it.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></span>
Hence an unprejudiced observer has no reason to put the ‘intuitions’
of philosophers and the ‘faculties’ which apprehend
them on a higher cognitive level than those of women or even
lunatics. They all impose themselves psychologically; but this
proves nothing as to their logical value, and science has to test
them just the same.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The principles which are said to be <i>necessary</i> or <i>logical</i>
‘<i>presuppositions</i>’ all turn out to be hypothetical when they are
examined. They are needed, no doubt, to solve the problem in
hand, <i>if</i> the particular way it is formulated is taken for granted.
But if either the order or the formulation of problems is altered,
they cease to be either ‘necessary’ or ‘presuppositions’. For
example, the ‘axiom of parallels’, <i>alias</i> ‘Euclid’s postulate’, is
a necessary presupposition of geometry, if the existence of parallels
is assumed. But if we prefer it, we can just as well (with Aristotle)
make it our axiomatic ‘presupposition’ that the interior angles
of a triangle are equal to two right angles, and can then deduce
the existence of parallels. I.e. Euclid might have deduced what
he assumed, and assumed what he deduced. If, moreover, we do
not desire to construct a Euclidean geometry at all, we can deny
<i>both</i> presuppositions, and proceed from <i>alternative</i> postulates,
which lead to the various metageometries. The only things, in
short, which all scientific principles presuppose are the desire to
construct a science, and the desire to construct it in a particular
way, which is simplest, or easiest, or most systematic, or most in
accordance with the reigning prejudices. But these desires are
the very things which the logician’s account of principles always
omits to mention.</p>

<p>Again, the whole of Kant’s scheme of <i>a priori</i> presuppositions
in the theory of knowledge rests upon an arbitrary assumption,
viz. that mental data are to be conceived as originally discrete
and are therefore in need of ‘synthesis’. But it is just as possible<span class="pagenum" title="251"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span>
to conceive an analysis of knowledge which starts from the ‘presupposition’
of a continuum or flux, and proceeds to trace out
the principles by means of which this continuum is broken up into
a world of apparently distinct things and processes. Nor is it
possible to say in advance of experience which of such ‘presuppositions’
is going to be more convenient and more conducive to
scientific progress.</p>

<p>(<a id="c"></a><i>c</i>) It demands a high and rare degree of philosophic insight
to perceive that very many principles are neither certain, necessary,
nor probable, but simply <i>methodological</i>. Whether we think them
true or not, we adopt them because of their eminent convenience.
If they turn out to be false, candour compels us to call them
<i>methodological fictions</i>; but they continue in use. Our belief in
the trustworthiness of memory is a good example. For though
we often find that our memory has played us tricks, we continue
to accept as true what we ‘distinctly remember’. If no limitations
to the truth-​claim of such assumptions are discovered,
enthusiasts will probably insist on promoting them to the rank
of indisputable ‘axioms’, and hail them as absolute truths. But
their scientific value is not thereby enhanced, and the cautious
will eschew such exaggerations. For there is no real reason why
the scientific rank of principles should not rest openly and entirely
on their actual services, and why a ‘methodological assumption’
should not rank higher than a ‘self-​evident truth’. For the latter
is at most a fact of our mental organization which nothing has so
far turned up in nature to set at naught, and as such a fact it
is itself a thing to marvel at rather than an explanation of other
things. The scientific spirit will always hesitate to acquiesce
in the limits which are set to inquiry by sheer brute facts,
and if the absolute truth of certain principles were merely an
ultimate fact which could neither be impugned nor explained,
this would go far to make these principles appear unintelligible
and would be a constant challenge to dispense with them, or
somehow to evade them. A principle, then, should always be prepared
to state the reasons a science had for adopting it: only
the reasons will appear from the actual working of the science.
They will involve a reference <i>forward</i> to the facts it copes with,
not <i>back</i> to higher principles or to any claim that proves itself by
its self-assertion.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Indisputable principles, then, are not consonant with the<span class="pagenum" title="252"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span>
spirit of inquiry: it will gladly let them go, if it can attain truth
and advance knowledge in other ways. It will not shrink even
from repudiating the ideal of absolutely true and demonstrated
truth, if it can be realized only by sacrificing the progressiveness
of science; nor will it be dismayed to find that this ideal is unrealizable.
For when the inquirer reflects upon his own procedure,
he finds that it points to a radically different ideal, and that the
existence of absolute truths would only be a hindrance and a
restriction upon his endeavour (cf. <a href="#zz4">§ 28 (4)</a>).</p>


<p class="tac mt15em">II</p>

<p>§ 16. Before, however, we attempt to delineate the logical ideal
of the discoverer, it will be necessary to encounter a serious
objection which protests on principle against such an undertaking,
and urges that discovery by its very nature must elude
logical treatment. It is contended, in the supposed interests of
logic, that discovery is a process so inherently and incurably
psychological that no logical account can ever be given of it.
Discoveries are windfalls, and come as ‘happy thoughts’ to the
gifted geniuses that make them, in a manner neither they nor any
one else can account for or describe: they are therefore logically
fortuitous, and to set forth the ideal of proof by which the truth
of discoveries is tested is all that need, or can, be the concern of
logic.</p>

<p>Certainly the great majority of deductive logicians have taken
up some such attitude towards the process of discovery. Aristotle
contents himself with a bare mention of ‘sagacity’ (ἀγχίνοια),
which is defined as the instantaneous apprehension of the suitable
middle term for constructing a demonstrative <span class="nowrap">syllogism.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></span> When
one recollects the weary centuries of painful effort and continual
failure which elapsed while the <i>élite</i> of the human race were seeking
for clues to, e.g., the mysteries of disease and of physical
happenings, before they hit upon the notions of microbes and the
mechanical theory, this naïve underestimate of the most difficult
and essential of scientific procedures sounds like a mockery. Yet
the whole Aristotelian school pass over the problem as lightly.
They all seem to believe that, while it is merely low cunning to
make a discovery, it is a real proof of mental capacity to arrange<span class="pagenum" title="253"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span>
it ‘in logical order’ after it has been made, and to show how far
short it falls of the logical ideal. Even the inductive logicians
may be said to have participated in this attitude. For they were
not more anxious to propound methods of discovery than to contend
that their conclusions were just as rigidly proved and just
as formally valid as those of syllogisms. They did not see that
they were thereby accepting the demonstrative ideal of proof and
giving away their own; what they should have shown was that
this ideal was utterly nugatory, and that their own methods
could never conduct to ‘proof’, but only to something vastly
superior.</p>

<p>§ 17. In spite, however, of this wonderful consensus of logicians
the above argument depends essentially on a confusion. It has
confused two things which are perfectly distinct, the actual procedure
of the individual discoverer, and the generalized description
of the attitude of mind and procedures of discoverers, as they
appear to subsequent logical reflection. Both present problems
to the logician, but the problems are not the same. To anticipate
the process of actual discovery may well be left to the prophets;
it will transcend the powers of logic and indeed of any science,
unless it be individual psychology, if it exists, or history, if it be
a <span class="nowrap">science.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></span> It may readily be admitted that anecdotes about the
bath which fomented in the mind of Archimedes the idea of
specific gravity, and the streets of Syracuse through which he ran
and cried ‘<i>Heureka!</i>’, or about the apple-tree which shed its fruit
upon Newton’s receptive head, and stimulated his brain to frame
the law of universal gravitation, are beneath the dignity of science.
Their narration belongs to history, which can go as deeply into
their details as the scale of the history and the purpose of the
historian demand; but the particular circumstances of a particular
discovery may well be treated as ‘accidental’, and be smoothed
out of the scientific record. But why does it follow that no common
features can be traced in these histories of discovery, and that
there cannot be compiled out of a sufficient number of them a
generalized account of what appears to be the ‘essential’, i.e.<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span>
really relevant, procedure of discoverers, which may serve as a
guide and model to subsequent discoverers? Why should this
be more difficult than to describe the method of lion-​hunting
from the records of lion hunts, or the treatment of a disease from
the history of a number of cases? Indeed, it would seem that
the thing has been done. Any discoverer may reflect upon his
own discoveries, and, like <span class="nowrap">Poincaré,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></span> formulate the method he has
found successful. And if discoverers are not all perfectly unique in
their methods, important uniformities will probably be found by
comparing the methods of a number of discoverers.</p>

<p>Why again should it be assumed that the general account thus
extracted from a retrospective study of discoveries must at once
coincide with the logical ‘ideal of proof’? Why should it even
point to this, or be related to it otherwise than by contrast?
Surely the possibility should be discussed that there are <i>two</i> procedures
for logic to consider, of which the one describes how
human knowers, starting from what they believe themselves to
know, set about it to fortify and extend their knowledge, while
the other moves on a superhuman plane and describes, with
Platonic fervour, how ideal demonstration, descending from absolutely
certain principles, moulds into a closed and inexpugnable
system all the truths which are deducible from these and alone
intelligible. The two accounts must be distinct, for they have
different starting-​points and work upon different material. Nor
need they ever have any point of contact. For it may well be that
human knowing never attains to an absolute certainty and a
completed system, while deductive proof never condescends to
notice mundane fact.</p>

<p>This was certainly so in the first rapturous vision of <i>a priori</i>
‘proof’ which solaced Plato amid the elusiveness and opacity
of the flow of happenings. The deduction of the intelligible order
of the ideal ‘Forms’ from their supreme ground and (<i>sole</i>!)
premiss in the ‘Idea of the Good’ stopped short of facts and
events at the <i>laws</i> of minimum <span class="nowrap">generality,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></span> and recognized in
all the happenings of the sensible world an ineradicable taint of
‘not-being’ which rendered their stability impossible and their
prediction vain. Aristotle similarly distinguished between the
procedure which started from the <i>notiora nobis</i>, the apparent facts<span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>
of perception, and that which began with the <i>notiora naturae</i>,
the self-​evident principles which could form the ultimate premisses
of demonstrations. But that these two methods must
somehow coincide was assumed rather than proved, in a way that
should have discredited the doctrine. For Aristotle also was not
able to explain how ‘science’, being of ‘universals’, could apply
to particulars, which nevertheless he would not with Plato stigmatize
as ‘unreal’, while the ascent from the sensible fact to the
‘universal’, which was called the ‘induction’ of the ‘principle’,
is hardly validated by the naïve allegation of a mental faculty of
‘intuitive reason’ (νου̑ς) endowed with the special function of
apprehending principles in their particular exemplifications. It is
high time, therefore, that this whole assumption that a necessary
congruity exists between the logic of discovery and of proof
should be subjected to a thorough examination.</p>


<p class="tac mt15em">III</p>

<p>§ <a id="z18"></a>18. Such an examination will speedily establish that the
mental attitude of the discoverer is, and must be, quite different
from that of the prover.</p>

<p>In the first place, the discoverer is not in possession of the
knowledge he covets. It is for him a desire, an aspiration, an aim
to be attained. Proof, on the other hand, presupposes knowledge.
Not only must the demonstrator <i>know</i> the assured truths he uses
as premisses, not only must he have a supply of absolutely certain
truths if his proof is not to remain hypothetical (<a href="#z9">§ 9</a>), but he must
already <i>know</i> the conclusion he exhibits. He cannot be ignorant,
like the discoverer, of the result he is to arrive at. He is not
engaged in <i>discovering</i> new truth, he is only showing how it <i>follows
from</i> old truths. His retrospective contemplation has merely to
retrace the history of its attainment, or rather to rearrange it in
the more pleasing order which he calls ‘logical’. This order is
not that in which it <i>was</i> discovered, nor even that in which it
<i>could be</i> discovered. For there are such things as necessary errors,
indispensable artifices, and indefensible fictions, and the way to
a truth often lies through them. Thus from time immemorial
mathematicians have represented the continuous by the discrete,
quantities by numbers, knowing full well what fictions their practice
involved. Again, mathematical calculation of shapes, areas,<span class="pagenum" title="256"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
and motions necessarily presupposes the fictions that bodies have
the ideal and regular forms to which they ‘approximate’, and
that their ‘mass’ is concentrated at their (ideal) ‘centre of
gravity’. It is more than doubtful whether the notion of an
‘evolution’ of species could ever have been reached, except by
starting from the false notion of the fixity of species, or whether
the true nature of the mobility and development of meanings
could have been understood except by correcting the Platonic
theory of immutable and eternal ‘universals’. To ‘proof’ all
these incidents and accidents of the history of discovery are
irrelevant; all that has to be done is to show that the new truth
can be deduced from the old, and that a ‘logical connexion’
exists between them.</p>

<p>§ 19. Not only is this much easier to do than to make the
discovery, but it is very much easier to follow. Any one can see
the connexion once the data have been arranged in logical order.
Hence the assumption that this order somehow represents the
actual process in a perfected form is natural enough. But it leads
to contempt for the procedure of discovery. The discovery is
made to look so easy that it becomes impossible to appreciate its
difficulty and its merit, and it seems astonishing that no one made
it long before. For did not the ‘facts’ all but force it upon the
dullest mind? Who could have failed to see that fossils must be
(at least) as old as the rocks in which they are embedded, that
obviously worked flints, similarly, attest the antiquity of man,
that northern Europe is scratched all over with the marks of a
gigantic glaciation? It is forgotten that these ‘facts’ were <i>not</i>
there until there came a mind prepared to notice them. Hence
none of these discoveries were in fact easy to make, and they
were preceded by a long struggle of the human mind with false preconceptions
and the illusory ‘facts’ which they had engendered.</p>

<p>Nor are discoveries easy to get recognized when they have been
made. The persecutions to which discoverers of new truth are
subjected always and everywhere (more or less) form as discreditable
a chapter of human history as the persecution of moral
reformers. Those may count themselves fortunate who are simply
ignored. Hence everything has to be ‘discovered’ over and over
again. Nothing new ever enters the world, just as nothing old
ever passes away, without infinite pains and after a protracted
struggle. One curious result of this inertia which deserves to<span class="pagenum" title="257"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span>
rank among the great fundamental ‘laws’ of nature, is that when
a discovery has finally won tardy recognition, it is usually found
to have been anticipated, often with cogent reasons and in great
detail. Darwinism, e.g., may be traced back through the ages
to Heraclitus and Anaximander. Thus it is true that there is
‘nothing new under the sun’; but only because when a new truth
first appears it does not prevail: when after a hundred repetitions
it is at length recognized, it is no longer strictly <i>new</i>. Accordingly,
the ‘discovery’ of a truth is only the beginning of its career,
the first step by which it makes its way in the world, and still
very distant from the crowning ‘proof’ with which logic complacently
adorns it <i>ex post facto</i>, when it has ‘arrived’. The
slowness and difficulty, then, with which the human race makes
discoveries, and its blindness to the most obvious facts, if it
happens to be unprepared or unwilling to see them, should suffice
to show that there is something gravely wrong about the logician’s
account of discovery.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z20"></a>20. Quite apart from the difficulties which the psychological
constitution and social organization of man put in the way of
innovators, the making of a new truth which formulates a new
‘fact’ is also intrinsically anxious work. It is not merely that
its maker can have no assurance that his enterprise will succeed,
that he cannot start with a feeling of certainty from established
truths, and be wafted by an irresistible wave of logical necessity
to the safe haven of a predestined conclusion. He <i>must</i> start with
a consciousness of ignorance and an all-​pervading feeling of doubt
about every step of his inquiry. This doubt he should not, moreover,
endeavour to disregard or to suppress; for it is the best
guarantee that no way to the truth will be passed by in his explorations.
Doubt, therefore, should be recognized on principle,
and equipped with a technique of testing and experimentation:
the inquirer should be proud that he has to feel his way in fear
and trembling to the very end.</p>

<p>Yet his condition will not contravene Aristotle’s dictum that
all inquiry and research proceed from knowledge previously <span class="nowrap">acquired.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></span>
In a sense he will still start from what he knows, or
thinks he knows. For it is psychologically impossible to do anything
else. The knowledge he believes himself to have cannot
but affect all his ideas, and he cannot get away from it. His<span class="pagenum" title="258"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>
boldest speculations, his most hazardous hypotheses, will have
<i>some</i> relation, however subtle and recondite, to the knowledge at
his disposal. It will influence all his thoughts and guide his
guesses. As he cannot divest himself of his knowledge and the
ideas it has rendered familiar to him, he has to accept its limitations.
His only problem is to use it as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>But it is clear that he cannot regard his knowledge with the
same sort and amount of confidence as the believer in demonstrative
proof. He must conceive himself as an explorer, and his
attitude must be tentative throughout. Knowing that his premisses
are questionable and only doubtfully true, he will recognize
that his inferences are only probable, and stand in need of confirmation.
As a rule he can, no doubt, find accepted truths to
argue from; but these being relative to the existing state of
knowledge are known to be subject to correction. Even where
he has started with premisses of the most superior kind, which
are generally deemed absolutely self-​evident and certain in themselves,
he will still be conscious of a doubt whether they will prove
to be the right premisses <i>for his purpose</i>. If they are not, their
truth is irrelevant and will lead him astray. In no case, therefore,
can he escape the responsibility of <i>choosing the right ones</i> from his
limited stock of known truths and familiar ideas, as he contemplates
the infinite expanse of possible discovery. In whatever
direction he moves, the unknown lies before him; he may come
upon surprises or be stopped by unsuspected obstacles. In short,
there is nothing of the irresistible about his progress; it has not
the faintest resemblance to the majestic march from inevitable
premisses to a predestined conclusion which so fascinates us in the
theory of proof.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z21"></a>21. But, it may be said, all this is not enough. The differences
in the attitudes assumed by the reasoner in discovery and
in proof may be only psychological. They do not prove any real
logical difference between them; the logician’s account may still
be what the discoverer would acknowledge to have been his best
course, if he could have seen it. It has, therefore, to be shown
that the differences in question arise out of, and develop into,
differences which are indisputably logical.</p>

<p>Thus, the ignorance which the inquirer feels is doubtless a
psychological fact, but the lack of knowledge which engenders it
is surely a logical fact of some importance. In general, the feelings<span class="pagenum" title="259"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span>
of doubt, expectancy, and perplexity which beset the mind of the
inquirer, and contrast so distinctly with the feelings of confidence,
knowledge, certainty, and necessity which accompany a ‘proof’,
originate in a logical fact. Every inquiry starts from a <i>problem</i>,
of which the solution is not yet known. An <i>inquiry</i> is, as the
name implies, a <i>question</i>, put, not to nature at large and at random,
but to some <i>part</i> of it, which is taken to be relevant and to contain
a possible answer to the inquirer’s question. Now this dependence
of inquiry upon problems springs no doubt from the psychological
fact that until there is something put before it the mind cannot
get to work upon it; but it is surely a fact of the utmost logical
significance, and it is astounding that the logical tradition should
have slurred it over so completely.</p>

<p>Especially as in the very beginnings of logic some of the Greeks
distinctly caught a glimpse of it. For, having started their reflection
upon reasoning from a desire to regulate debate and to
argue a case at law, they naturally noticed that there are two sides
(at least) to every question. Accordingly, Protagoras appears to
have taught systematically that there were always two reasonings
(λόγοι) to be <span class="nowrap">considered,<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></span> Socrates, treated scientific inquiry as an
extension of the art of cross-​examination, and Plato conceived
the search for ideal truth as a ‘dialectical’ process, as a sort of
dialogue of the soul with itself. Now this whole doctrine is equally
good as logic and as psychology. It is profoundly true of the
inquirer’s mind; he must be keenly alive, not only to the evidence
<i>for</i>, but also to that <i>against</i> his working theory. But it is also
true of the logical nature of inquiry that it is a process of determining
<i>which</i> of the alleged ‘facts’ and of the theories to interpret
them are real and true. Inquiry logically ‘presupposes’ a conflict
between the data, and a dispute about them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the conception of scientific research
as an inquiry lapses from the logical consciousness in consequence
of Aristotle’s work. His discovery of the forms and formulas of
demonstration overshadowed it, and restored the reign of dogma
which is so congenial to the authorities <span class="nowrap">everywhere.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></span> The true
conception of inquiry does not revive again until our days, when
Mr. Alfred Sidgwick and Professor John Dewey have endeavoured,
not with the success they deserved, to reopen the eyes of logicians
to the facts of the scientific situation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="260"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span></p>

<p>§ <a id="z22"></a>22. To conceive an inquiry as a question then is, we see,
implicitly to conceive it as having a plurality of answers, all of
which have to be examined. All these answers are initially hypotheses,
and a choice has to be made between them. This renders
the recognition of alternatives a paramount necessity for a logic
of discovery, which can no longer dismiss them with a jejune
chapter on ‘disjunctive propositions’. Their existence is no
longer to be treated as an annoying complication which delays
the progress of science, but must be taken to inhere in the logical
nature of problems, and to be essential to their proper elucidation.</p>

<p>Logic, therefore, should regard it as its duty to inquire (1) how
the inquirer is furnished with an adequate supply of theories for
analysing and testing the apparent facts of his subject, (2) what
methods are used to sift hypotheses and to select the more valuable,
and (3) if it can, to add some hints as to how theories and methods
<i>ought</i> to be handled.</p>

<p>(1) To the first question there is no exhaustive answer. No
logic can guarantee that <i>all</i> the possible theories which concern
the facts under inquiry will be available. They may not yet have
occurred to any human mind, and may never do so. This alone
ought to be considered a fatal objection to all methods which presuppose
exhaustiveness, and are pressed by the logician upon the
man of science. It ought to dispose of methods which demand
that <i>all</i> the facts should be assembled before theorizing is begun,
or that <i>all</i> the alternatives should be stated and the true one
extracted by the successive elimination of the false ones, or that
define a ‘cause’ as reciprocating with its ‘effect’, and assume
that the true cause has been discovered when no other has been
thought of, or that if a theory works we may take it that it alone
will do so and is (absolutely) true. All these notions demand an
impossible exhaustion of the alternatives, and try to convert
a (psychological) failure to think of any more into a logical proof
that there are no more. And they all regard the plurality of
alternatives as a hindrance to be got rid of, and not as a safeguard
and a help to proper inquiry.</p>

<p>Hence the real difficulty was not perceived, viz. that there is
no formal guarantee that the supply of hypotheses for use upon
the facts in any inquiry will be adequate. It may well be that
for lack of a good working theory to go upon, all the theorizing on
a subject proves vain and sterile. In the beginnings of all the<span class="pagenum" title="261"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
sciences this sort of condition always exists and often lasts for
centuries, and it is a main reason why some sciences make little
progress even now.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the difficulty is not in practice as fatal as it looks
on paper. It is probable that the inquirer will in fact usually have
a supply of alternatives to start from. For (<i>a</i>) he will naturally
select a subject in which there are disputed points. And (<i>b</i>), what
is even more important, human minds are naturally various:
they put, therefore, different interpretations on the same facts and
value them differently. Some are attracted by novelty, others
by orthodoxy; some incline to one type of theory and method of
inquiry, others to another. Hence in any inquiry upon which a
number of minds are actively engaged, there will always be differences
of opinion, and these will be most marked in the rapidly
growing regions of every progressive science, which, like the
growing cells in the trunk of a tree, are always on the outskirts.
There will always be a conservative and a liberal party, even in
science, and the clash between their views will always provide
alternative solutions of problems, the comparative merits of which
the inquirer can examine. But the sciences owe their progress
largely to the man who raises new questions, and should provide
for him in their organization.</p>

<p>§ 23. It should be noted further that if this feature in discovery
were properly recognized and emphasized, it would have important
educational and ethical effects. At present the study of logic can
hardly be said to liberalize and broaden the mind or to improve
the temper. So long as its chief interest is in a theory of absolute
proof and complete certainty, it will tend to breed pedants and
bigots. The effect would be very different if an adequate logic of
discovery had imbued the mind with an ever-​present thought that
every subject may and must be considered from several points of
view, and that an inquirer should beware of letting his predilections
and preconceptions blind him to possible alternatives. The
logical attitude of inquiry, when fully understood, demands a
tolerant and open mind, and excludes the narrow-​mindedness and
dogmatism which the theory of proof has fostered by its pretence
of showing that there was but one truth and one inevitable way
of reaching it. Moreover, the necessity of continually choosing
between a number of alternatives should cultivate a judicial
temper, conducing to fair-​mindedness and consideration towards<span class="pagenum" title="262"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span>
the views of others. For a mind which is in the habit of choosing
between alternatives must be impressed by the facts that there is
something to be said for the views it does not accept, that the view
accepted is often not so very much superior to those rejected, and
that new facts and new knowledge may always revive views which
were supposed to be defunct.</p>

<p>Of course our natural dogmatism will take alarm at the flabby
toleration of ideas which this attitude seems to imply. It will be
objected that no one who can see the good and truth in beliefs he
does not accept, can really be strenuous in upholding those he
does. The full answer to this bigots’ argument can only be
appreciated when the attitude of progressive science is fully understood
(cf. <a href="#z33">§ 33</a>), but in general it may be pointed out that a power
of first weighing alternatives, choosing the best and acting upon
it strenuously, is precisely what life demands of us at every step.
It should not, therefore, be impossible to compass it in science.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z24"></a>24. (2) To the second question of <a href="#z22">§ 22</a>, viz. what are the
methods used by the inquirer in sifting the alternative hypotheses
in the field, and picking out the most valuable, the answer is
comparatively easy. It is substantially the answer given by the
pragmatist analysis of knowledge. That theory is preferred, and
tends to be accepted as true, which for the time being <i>works</i> best.
The formula looks simple, but needs more thinking out than its
critics usually bestow upon it.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) It implies, of course, that <i>all</i> the alternatives (before the
mind) ‘work’ more or less. They must be (or appear) scientifically
plausible, and proffer a more or less satisfactory explanation
of some or all of the admitted ‘facts’. This is why agencies like
the Devil, who could once be extensively alleged to explain
anything unusual, have dropped out of the purview of science.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) ‘Working’ must be conceived somewhat widely. Its
<i>primary</i> appeal is to the accepted principles and recognized
interests of the science; practically to ‘work’ means to conduce
to the development of the science on the recognized lines, and the
proper judges of what ‘working’ counts are the experts who cultivate
each science.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) But there will often be complications due to certain disputable
workings, of which the relevance is not yet established,
and about these there will legitimately be differences of opinion.
These should not be suppressed, but candidly argued out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="263"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Moreover, every <i>new</i> departure will be <i>pro tanto</i> disputable,
because it will conflict more or less with the vested interests of the
established doctrines. One great factor in the ‘working’ of a new
truth is the extent to which it upsets, or is thought to upset, the
old, and demands a reconstruction of beliefs, a correction of authorities,
a revision of text-books, a renewal of plant, &amp;c. Hence
what works best in the abstract may not do so under the actual
conditions. It may ‘pay’ a professor better to be ‘orthodox’
than to be an innovator, and he is usually quite alive to this,
though it does not render him a good investment scientifically
for the institution that appoints him. If then we looked at this
side of the matter alone, the verdict would always go against the
novelty. For very few new truths are fortunate enough to find
the field free and unoccupied. Usually they have to spring up
in a soil densely overgrown with a rank growth of prejudices,
dogmas, and superstitions, to which the world is accustomed and
even devoted. So they have to fight for an opening in which they
can take root and grow up.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The ‘working’, however, need not amount to a claim to
represent ‘the’ truth. A discoverer may know that by reason of
his deliberate use of fictions, his results have forfeited their claims
to be strictly true; yet they may ‘work’ better than anything
else in sight. The typical example here is, of course, mathematics.
When physical objects are treated mathematically, they are identified
by a fiction with the objects of pure mathematics, and it is
only on this assumption that their behaviour can be calculated.
They are, of course, vastly <i>more</i> than mathematical objects, but
their surplus meaning becomes irrelevant wherever objects admit
of mathematical treatment. And apart from the restriction of the
claim to truth necessitated by the use of fictions, it should, of
course, be recognized also that there are sound logical reasons for
denying that truths which rest on their ‘workings’ can ever be
‘absolute’ (<a href="#z26">§ 26</a> <i>s.f.</i>). Their truth is pragmatic, and is <i>optimi
iuris</i> only if pragmatism establishes that no other and no better
truth exists.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) More specifically a very important form of working is the
prediction of events. Knowledge of the future is an almost universal
object of human desire, which men have sought to compass
by fair means and foul, and the calculation of the future is the
avowed aim of many scientific inquiries. Hence there is nothing<span class="pagenum" title="264"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span>
more potent to dispose the mind to accept a theory than the
success of the predictions it has led to. Yet here again this form
of ‘working’ differs generically from ‘proof’. It is clear that
prediction is not strictly proof. For predictions may be made
with considerable accuracy by the aid of hypotheses which turn
out to be false or impossible. Thus eclipses and other celestial
events were predicted for centuries by means of the Ptolemaic
astronomy, and they cannot be predicted even now with absolute
accuracy. Indeed, physically speaking, absolute accuracy is unthinkable.
No instrument and no organ of observation can be
conceived to measure to more than a finite degree of accuracy,
and the <i>best value</i> for any physical ‘fact’ will always be the
mean of a number of good observations after all the accessible
sources of error have been allowed for.</p>

<p>At no point, then, does the test of ‘working’ conduct to the
notion that absolute truth is discoverable. But the right inference
may be, not that the test is worthless, but that absolute truth is
a chimera.</p>

<p>§ 25. (3) It cannot then be seriously disputed either that
alternative hypotheses are always (more or less consciously) present
to the mind of the inquirer, or that the working of a theory
is in fact used, in all the sciences, to test its claim to be true. But
does it follow that logic should bow to scientific fact and recognize
these practices? Should it set itself to devise a <i>technique</i> for
regulating the formation of hypotheses and the establishment of
their truth by their working? It is here that the traditional logic
demurs, and disputes begin. Nevertheless, strong reasons may be
advanced for answering both questions in the affirmative.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) An abundance of hypotheses is a guarantee of great logical
value that all the important facts will be properly observed. For
it is evident that every theory will produce a certain <i>bias</i> in the
observer. It will direct his attention upon those facts and those
features which are <i>relevant</i> to his theory, and, more particularly,
which <i>support</i> it. This is usually an advantage, because it helps
him to select what is relevant to his inquiry from the chaos of
events; but it will <i>pari passu</i> blind him to whatever does not
seem to be related to, and to fit into, his theory. He will, therefore,
fail to observe and to appreciate what will seem to him to have
little or no scientific interest. And in so thinking he may be quite
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="265"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span></p>

<p>The old theory of ‘induction,’ thought to get over this difficulty
by saying, ‘Well, of course, <i>all</i> the facts must be observed’.
It did not observe the fact that in practice this is impossible, and
is never done. Nothing is observed but what the knowledge and
preconceptions of the time make visible to the scientific eye. Of
what is visible at any time only a small part seems worthy of the
scientific microscope. Complete observation, therefore, of literally
all the facts is scientifically impracticable.</p>

<p>As a logical ideal also this notion of all-​inclusiveness is absurd.
If no inquiry could ever begin until <i>all</i> the facts had been assembled,
how could anything be discovered until omniscience had been
achieved, i.e. when there was nothing left to discover? For how
are we to know that our assembly of ‘facts’ really is complete?
And if literally all the facts have to be used as data in any inquiry,
shall we not speedily find that every fact ramifies into infinity,
and drags in the totality of reality, and a knowledge of all things
present, past, and future? This ‘logical ideal’, therefore, renders
inquiry impossible.</p>

<p>In point of fact the data of any inquiry are always a <i>selection</i>.
They are such of the recognized facts as are thought to be <i>relevant</i>,
i.e. to be truly ‘facts’ for the purpose in hand. But being a
selection they involve us in the risk that we may have selected
wrongly, and omitted what is important while admitting what
is not. <i>From this risk there is no escape.</i> For we cannot effect
a compromise by including merely so much of the facts as we can
lay hold of. Not only does this yield no guarantee that everything
that is needed has been included, but it may be a positive
hindrance to try to include too much. For if our data grow into
an unwieldy mass, they will not seem susceptible of any order or
principle, and even the most penetrating inquirer will lose his way.</p>

<p>It is better, therefore, to give up altogether the idea of securing
formal validity by postulating an all-​inclusive exhaustiveness.
The obvious alternative is to operate simultaneously with a
plurality of theories, each of which means a certain ordering of the
‘facts’ relatively to what seems a relevant and promising point
of view. Each will involve a selection and induce a bias; but
with any luck they will neutralize each other’s bias, and so will
increase the probability that no really relevant fact has escaped
notice. This will not satisfy the logical ‘ideal’, but in practice it
means a good deal, and is enough for scientific progress. Of course<span class="pagenum" title="266"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a></span>
it must be understood that the hypotheses employed are in a
general way relevant to the problems and the condition of the
sciences, and not random guesses. This proviso will cut down
their exuberance even more than the limitations of the human
imagination, which seems to be psychologically incapable of really
departing very far from the suggestions of experience.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z26"></a>26. When logic has recognized the use and value of ‘working’
as the test of truth, it must, however, make it clear to itself and
to others both what precisely this test is, and what it can, and
cannot, accomplish.</p>

<p>In the first place, it must be made clear that it is <i>not</i> a logical
implication of the test that ‘whatever works is true’, and the
reasons for disputing this dictum must be set forth. The fact is
that we all have a strong psychological tendency to believe in the
truth of what is found to work, without much criticism of the
sort and extent of the ‘working’. But the logician should carefully
investigate the various sorts of working that occur, and take
special note of those which either do not themselves lay claim to
full truth, or do not (ordinarily) have their claim conceded.</p>

<p>For example, ‘<i>fictions</i>’ are not supposed to be strictly true;
but they may ‘work’ and be ‘as good as true’, or ‘pragmatically
true’, or ‘sufficiently true for the purpose in hand’. They work,
in fact, within limits; but these limits are <i>known</i>, and so they are
not confused with full-​fledged truths, to the applicability of which
there are no known limits.</p>

<p>The case of ‘<i>methodological assumptions</i>’ is more difficult and
instructive, and is usually misconceived. In their case the existence
of limits to their ‘working’ is either not known or not relevant,
because they owe their adoption to their use and convenience in
analysing and organizing a subject of inquiry. Thus the principle
of Causation, the assumption that every event has a cause which
determines it fully, is properly to be regarded as methodological.
It declares merely that if we desire to calculate the course of
events, it is scientifically convenient to treat events as if they had
‘causes’, from which their occurrence could be predicted, whether
or not they have them in fact. This assumption may be purely
methodological; it need not, and should not, be turned into a
dogmatic, metaphysical denial that there may be indeterminate
happenings. There may even be good reasons to suspect their
occurrence, and indeterminism may be ultimately true, and yet<span class="pagenum" title="267"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></span>
scientific method may rightly ignore this possibility, because it
would render the calculation of events <span class="nowrap">impossible.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></span> Even an
indeterminist then is fully entitled to reason <i>as if</i> events were
determined, and to search for ‘causes’, for the purely methodological
reason that this enables him to calculate events, and
that after all they may be calculable. So long as they work
for scientific purposes it is not, in the case of methodological
principles, necessary to raise the question of their metaphysical
truth.</p>

<p>The ‘lie’ again is a curious case of ‘working’. A lie, works, as
a rule, only so long as it passes for truth, and is believed to have
the meaning and value its author claims for it; when it is ‘found
out’, it ceases to work. Hence it can both work and fail to work
at the same time, according as it is, or is not, known to be a ‘lie’.
Clearly nothing can be made of the lie logically, until this double
aspect inherent in its nature is recognized; if the logician refuses
to distinguish between the <i>persons</i> concerned in its making,
acceptance, and rejection, it remains (like ‘error’ to Plato) an
insoluble ‘contradiction’. It is, however, a mere prejudice to
refuse to make these distinctions.</p>

<p>The ‘working’ of hypotheses is by no means simple and unambiguous.
It admits of infinite gradations in amount and kind,
and the ‘truth’ which is implicated in ‘working’ is nothing
essentially but an index of its logical value, and may vary in
quantity between values which cannot be <i>psychologically</i> discriminated
from zero and from 100% or 1 (= ‘absolute’ certainty).
It is crude, therefore, to confront a scientific hypothesis
with the rigid alternative ‘either (absolutely) true, or (utterly)
false’; its ‘truth’ really rests on its greater value, as compared
with its competitors. Its value, then, is a question of more or
less. The more extensively, conveniently, and economically a
hypothesis works, the more value has it, i.e. the more likely
is it to be called ‘true’, and to be supposed true absolutely: the
more continuously and successfully the test of working has been
applied to a doctrine, the greater the confidence and affection
with which it is regarded, and the greater the presumption that
it will continue to approve itself as true.</p>

<p>But, as we anticipated in <a href="#z24">§ 24</a> (<i>s.f.</i>), it is vain to expect to
establish any absolute truth by this method. It provides truth<span class="pagenum" title="268"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a></span>
with ever-​growing probability, but never with absolute certainty.
For, however well a theory works, the thought that one may hereafter
be found to work better can never logically be excluded.
Even if every one alive were perfectly satisfied, and no one could
imagine any improvement in an accepted truth&mdash;and these conditions
are by no means often realized&mdash;such psychological considerations
would not disprove the logical possibility that the
best known was not the best absolutely, and logic would continue
to distinguish between a truth that was absolute, and one liable
to one billionth chance of error. The latter chance could be
disregarded for all practical and scientific purposes, and would
not have the slightest psychological effect on the confidence with
which the truth was regarded; but logically it would still be
there. Science, therefore, has to resign itself to the conclusion
that its method cannot conceivably attain to absolute truth, and
to make the best of it.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z27"></a>27. Curiously enough this conclusion is fully confirmed by
Formal Logic. It prides itself on pointing out that there is a formal
fallacy involved in establishing truth by ‘working’. The essence
of this method is to argue that if a theory is found to work (after
the proper precautions have been taken), it is true. If e.g. the
events anticipated by a theory occur, and nothing occurs that
could not be anticipated, it grows more and more probable until
it convinces every one. But ought it logically to have done this?
The logician declares emphatically, it ought not. For the argument
suffers from an incurable flaw, which has been recorded as a
‘fallacy’ for over 2,000 years. It is a flagrant ‘affirmation of
the consequent’; symbolically, it argues that <i>if A is, B is, but
B is, ∴ A is</i>. Now this is not ‘cogent’ or ‘valid’. That <i>A is</i>
can be proved only from the premiss ‘<i>only</i> if A is, B is’, i.e. if
A is the <i>only</i> theory which will account for the observed consequences.
But this the fallacious method did not assert, and
indeed could not assert. For that the best known is the best
absolutely never can be proved (cf. <a href="#z26">§ 26</a>); and even if they happened
to be identical, and we had somehow stumbled upon an
absolute truth, we should never know that this was so.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z28"></a>28. To the logician this fact only seems to prove the superiority
of his conception of ‘proof’. He infers, consistently enough,
that no inductive reasoning from ‘facts’, no verification of hypotheses
by events, can possibly amount to proof. What he seeks<span class="pagenum" title="269"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a></span>
to impress upon his pupils is that <i>verification is not proof and can
never lead to it</i>.</p>

<p>He considers himself entitled to look down upon science
accordingly, its evidence, its methods, and its reasonings, and to
contrast them with the absoluteness of his own ideal of demonstration.
He upholds its validity in spite of all the failures of the
sciences to realize it. As a rule he seems willing to grant that
some mathematical proofs amount to logical <span class="nowrap">demonstration;<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></span>
but if pressed he would confess that scientific truth was only
probable, whereas certain metaphysical truths, such as the law of
contradiction, alone were absolutely certain.</p>

<p>The scientist, of course, is not in a position to deny that the
nature of his truth is such as has been stated: but he should not
attempt to do so. He should content himself with scientific truth,
and contend that at its best it is good enough for any one. And
he can carry the war into Africa by a vigorous counter-attack.</p>

<p>(1) He can deny&mdash;for the reasons stated in <a href="#z13">§ 13</a>&mdash;that the
logician’s formal ‘proof’ is as cogent and formally valid as the
latter supposes, and show that after a conclusion has been ‘<i>proved</i>’
true, it has still to <i>come true</i> before it can be trusted to be ‘true’.</p>

<p>(2) He can point out that there is a serious <i>lacuna</i> in the
logician’s plea for his notion of ‘proof’. The logician has assumed
that the only alternative to his belief in absolutely certain premisses
is complete scepticism, arguing that it must be possible to
start from certainty, because otherwise no knowledge would be
possible at all. He then urged ‘but there clearly <i>is</i> knowledge&mdash;the
sciences attest it’, and consistently inferred that absolutely
certain premisses must be obtainable. The more or less obvious
failure of his attempts to explain their genesis by ‘self-​evidence’,
‘intuition’, ‘necessities of thought’, &amp;c. (<a href="#z15">§ 15</a>), could not deter
him from clinging to his belief, because the principles themselves
seemed to him to be inevitable and to admit of no alternative.</p>

<p>In fact, however, there <i>is</i> a <i>via media</i> between scepticism and
absolutism, and science safely pursues it, though logic has over<span class="pagenum" title="270"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a></span>looked
it. It is <i>not</i> necessary to start with absolutely certain
premisses, because it is possible to adopt premisses hypothetically,
to take them as true for the argument’s sake and for the purposes
of the inquiry, to experiment with them, and to revise them in
the light of the results of such experiments. Thus <i>their</i> value
may be judged and established, <i>after</i> their adoption, by the experimental
results, and they may come to depend logically upon
these, and not upon the processes (analogies, suggestions, guesses,
fancies, &amp;c.) which led to their adoption. If they show themselves
capable of advancing the science and solving its problems, confidence
in their ‘truth’ increases progressively, and their initial
assumption is justified. They <i>cease</i> to be ‘hypotheses’ and
become ‘facts’, and even ‘principles’ beyond dispute. If they
fail to ‘work’, they may be discarded in favour of others which
are tried in their turn and similarly tested. Hence it is not true
that what is uncertain to begin with must always remain so, nor
is it hard to understand that hypothesis, willingness to believe,
and belief may be the psychological forerunners of logical proof,
which, nevertheless, rests not upon them, but upon the solid value
of the results subsequently reached by their means. The certainty
of scientific premisses then admits of indefinite growth, which at
some point or other will overpower even the most obstinately
sceptical temper. This point naturally lies at a greater distance
from the starting-​point for some minds than for others, but when
it is reached, and when the last doubts and scruples have been
overcome, the triumphant truth will <i>feel</i> absolutely certain, and
to all intents and purposes will function as such. But the ‘practical
certainty’ thus achieved will still be distinguishable in thought
from the absolute certainty which logical theory mistakenly demanded.
And logicians, from Plato <span class="nowrap">downwards,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></span> will be convicted
of having failed to allow for the possibility that the certainty of
premisses and principles may be a fruit of continuous experience
and experiment, and to perceive that this is the method the
sciences have actually employed. In short, necessary (needed)<span class="pagenum" title="271"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a></span>
‘truths’ need <i>not</i> be regarded as ‘<i>a priori</i>’, if it is seen how
hypotheses are consolidated by experience.</p>

<p>(3) The scientist can deny that the ideal case, contemplated
with so much satisfaction by the logician, can ever occur in actual
knowing. He can point out that if the logical apparatus of demonstration
is to work, it must be supplied with premisses that are absolutely
true. But whence is the logician to obtain them? The
‘self-​evident’ principles and ‘necessary’ axioms, for which so much
has been claimed, have been shown (<a href="#z15">§ 15</a>) to be highly disputable,
and are themselves in need of support and verification. The
truths which the sciences supply abundantly are all products of
the method to which he takes exception. There are no scientific
truths which have not to be, and have not been, verified, and if
verification is logically vicious, and cannot amount to proof, they
are not absolutely true. But if the premisses of a demonstration
are not absolutely true, neither can its conclusion be. What then
becomes first of the value, and ultimately of the ‘validity’, of
an ideal of proof which can never be exemplified by actual reasoning,
and serves only to condemn it?</p>

<p><a id="zz4"></a>(4) The ideal of absolute certainty may be repudiated altogether,
even as an ideal, for sound scientific reasons. It may be
shown that if it were possible it would be scientifically undesirable.
For it would mean the creation of absolute bars to scientific progress.
If truths existed which were absolutely certain, this would
mean that nothing more could be learnt about them, and nothing
could be done to strengthen their position. No experience, no
inquiry, no experiment, could any longer affect them, and add to
or detract from their value. They could not, therefore, form
avenues to further knowledge. They would simply be stops
which would arrest scientific inquiry. But how could such things
form an ideal of scientific knowledge? How could it be in the
spirit, and to the interest, of science to recognize them? They
would merely be for science brute facts which it was forbidden to
investigate. And must not science on principle hold out for the
right to inquire into everything, to test every belief, however true
it may seem? How, then, can it be the ideal of science to adopt
an ideal which would stop inquiry?</p>

<p>Nor will it suffice in reply to point to the fact that the sciences
continually assume the truth of the premisses they argue from.
For though this is often a convenient assumption for the purpose<span class="pagenum" title="272"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a></span>
in hand, it is one thing to assume the truth of premisses for the
purposes of an inquiry, and quite another to assume it absolutely.
For in the former case our assumption may be, and should be,
accompanied by a consciousness that upon another and fitting
occasion the premisses now assumed to be true may themselves
be inquired into: to regard them, therefore, as absolute is to
misinterpret their logical condition.</p>

<p>There are no good reasons, then, why the sciences should
surrender to the arbitrary demands of the traditional logic, and
sacrifice their practices which have been sanctified by the successes
of 2,000 years to theories which sprang from a misunderstanding
of scientific procedure, and have since lost all contact
with it. The original mistake was pardonable, but it ought not
to be regarded as an insult to logic to require it to understand the
procedure by which the sciences actually progress.</p>

<p>§ 29. The scientist then should not be terrified by the charge
that his ‘truths’ are ‘only probable’. For it is better to be
satisfied with probabilities than to demand impossibilities and
starve. Moreover, a high degree of probability means ‘practical
certainty’, i.e. confidence enough to move to action. Such
certainty so convinces and satisfies the mind that it cannot feel
more certain about anything; the logical gap between it and
absolute certainty is psychologically negligible. We are sacrificing,
therefore, nothing but a superstition, nothing that has any value
for us, by renouncing the demand for absolute truth and demonstrative
‘proof’, and we gain in return a charter of liberty. For
to admit the essential progressiveness of scientific truth and its
indefinite capacity for improvement means unlimited freedom to
research into truths which are infinitely perfectible, because they
are never ‘absolute’. The ideal of the infinite perfectibility of
truth, and the infinite progressiveness of science, is more than an
adequate substitute for the ‘logical ideal’ which is abandoned.
For not only is it an ideal which works, but it really embodies
a nobler aspiration than that which represented science as ‘resting’
in absolute perfection on fixed ‘foundations’ of ‘eternal’ truth.
The sentiment which inspires this group of metaphors is given
away by the word ‘rest’. A science that desires to <i>rest</i> is one
that is unwilling to <i>move</i> and unable to <i>advance</i>. Fixed ‘foundations’
are needed only for standing firm and standing still, and
it turns out that what is strictly meant by ‘eternal’ is not that<span class="pagenum" title="273"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a></span>
truths last for ever, but that they are not related to ‘time’ at all,
and so have really no application to <span class="nowrap">‘events’.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, a science which sincerely desires to progress
needs fixed foundations as little as fixed ideas, and firm ground as
little as assurances to ‘rest’ on. It needs only a starting-​point,
or jumping-off place, whence it can plunge into the unharvested
seas of the unknown. Now the essence of a starting-​point is to
be a place you want to get away from, and its excellence lies in
being such as to prompt you to leave it as easily and eagerly as
possible. If, therefore, scientific ‘principles’ (ἀρχαί) are really to
be starting-​points, they need not, and must not, be so comfortable
and so deceptively similar to ‘absolute’ truths as to tempt the
scientific spirit to repose. They should be tentative assumptions
which are gladly abandoned in the hope of reaching something
better, stepping-​stones to farther and higher things, which are
valued for their consequences, and logically dependent on the conclusions
to which they formed the premisses. The logic of science,
therefore, has no reason to postulate stability or solidity for its
initial principles: the most indispensable of them are only principles
of method, and even of the tried and tested principles it
arrives at the ‘validity’ (=&nbsp;strength) demanded is merely that
they should be able to float the accumulated wealth of knowledge
down the stream of time.</p>


<p class="tac mt15em">IV</p>

<p>§ 30. It is clear, then, that the time has come when Science
should break decisively with the logical tradition, and proclaim
a logic of its own which has always been implicit in its procedure.
It must definitely declare that what it needs is not a logic which
describes only the static relations of an unchanging system of
knowledge, but one which is open to perceive motion, and willing
to appreciate the dynamic process of a knowledge that never
ceases to grow, and is never really stereotyped into a system.
To show that such a logic is not inconceivable will be the
endeavour of the concluding sections of this essay.</p>

<p>We have already had occasion to note many of the most
important features of this logic. We have seen that logical, i.e.
critical, reflection upon discovery must start from, and be guided<span class="pagenum" title="274"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a></span>
by, the conception of a scientific <i>problem</i> with which the process
of knowing <i>experiments</i> (<a href="#z21">§ 21</a>). This problem has, of course, to be
attacked with the existing resources of a science, i.e. with the
knowledge it possesses up to date. These resources form the
scientific <i>capital</i> which is necessarily <i>risked</i> in research if it is to
yield interest. It comprises (<i>a</i>) approved principles, (<i>b</i>) known
facts, and (<i>c</i>) established meanings of words. About each of them
a little more may advantageously be said.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) We have seen (<a href="#z15">§ 15</a>) that the principles of any science could
not rightly be conceived as inscrutable, ultimate, absolute certainties
of divine descent, and acknowledging no human ancestry.
We saw that they could be understood only as hypotheses
which reflection upon a problem had somehow suggested to an
ingenious mind, which had been provisionally adopted in order
to explore and organize a subject of inquiry, and had finally been
verified and confirmed by their success (<a href="#c">§ 15 (<i>c</i></a>), <a href="#z24">§ 24</a>).</p>

<p>The principles thus accepted by a science are often regarded
as descriptive of fact when they are merely methodological and
<span class="nowrap">convenient,<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></span> but this is a point of secondary importance. And
even the most amply verified principles never quite lose their
hypothetical character. So long as they are used, their meaning,
scope, and truth are not absolutely fixed. They can be extended,
restricted, and modified by the working of the principles.</p>

<p>§ 31. (<i>b</i>) It is really obvious to any critical reflection that when
a science appeals to ‘facts’, it is really appealing to the facts <i>as
known</i>, or supposed to be known. It cannot from the first presume
its knowledge to be absolute, and, <i>pace</i> some of our ‘neo-realists’,
ignore the question whether the alleged facts are facts at all, and
so pretend to start from ‘the facts as they really are’. Such
uncritical temerity would only conduct to insoluble pseudo-​problems
like that with which King Charles plagued the nascent
Royal Society, as to <i>why</i> the weight of a bucket full of water
was not increased when a fish was added to it. If, however, it is
acknowledged that the ‘facts’ involved in a scientific inquiry are
always relative to a definite state and date in the history of a
science, several important corollaries follow.</p>

<p>(1) Being dependent on the condition of the science, the facts<span class="pagenum" title="275"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></span>
of a science will not all be ‘facts’. That is, not all that is relevant
to the interest of the science will actually be within its cognizance,
not all that turns out to be fact, and is antedated when it has been
discovered, is as yet recognized as fact. It will be this fact, moreover,
which constitutes the science a field for inquiry and renders
it progressive.</p>

<p>(2) Though the ‘facts’ of the moment fail to include all the
facts, they often manage to include too much. The ‘facts’ are
not all fact. They include unknown, and often large, amounts of
prejudice, illusion, error, superstition, and other remnants of the
lurid past and stormy youth of every science. It is useless to
repine at this inevitable consequence of past history, and childish
to try to purge it away by defining as science only what <i>ex hypothesi</i>
is free from such contaminations. To restrict the logical
interest to science <i>qua</i> science, which is by definition infallible,
is to forbid any logical treatment of the sciences we actually
possess. But the logician should surely be encouraged to study
the processes by which the sciences correct their initial errors and
consolidate their acquisitions.</p>

<p>(3) It follows on both these grounds that the ‘facts’ of which
a science takes cognizance will be subject to change. As the science
grows, ‘new’ facts will come into it, and old facts will be discarded
as erroneous. In particular, facts which at first were only
inferred on theoretic grounds will be actually observed, even as
‘Neptune’ was the fruit of a theory about the perturbations of
Uranus. Hence the antithesis of ‘theory’ and ‘fact’ must not
be taken as absolute: they must be expected to play into each
other’s hands. It is the business of theories to forecast ‘facts’,
and of facts to form points of departure for theories, which again,
when verified by the new facts to which they have successfully
led, will extend the borders of knowledge. Incidentally, however,
this interaction between fact and theory often renders it difficult
to decide whether a scientific doctrine is better regarded as a
‘theory’ or as a ‘fact’, and leads to differences of opinion. But
it can hardly be wrong to advise the scientific mind to practise
hospitality towards new facts, while it is no less fitting to show
generosity towards old servants that have done their work and
can now advantageously be retired. It is ungrateful to abuse them
as ‘errors’, and to despise them with the lofty contempt of the
higher knowledge to which they have conducted. And in both<span class="pagenum" title="276"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a></span>
cases the truly scientific attitude may be attained if an element of
fanaticism is not imported into the conception of truth by attributing
to it an absoluteness which no human truth in fact possesses.</p>

<p>(4) The same need for tolerance is emphasized by a further
corollary of the conception of fact which has been advocated.
It seems at first a paradox, but on reflection appears to be evident,
that the ‘facts’ will not only <i>look</i> different but may really <i>be</i>
different from different points of view and for different purposes.
Once we permit ourselves to consider this possibility we shall
easily perceive that there often are conflicts between ‘facts’, such
that they cannot coexist for an abstract logic, while, nevertheless,
each of the conflicting facts may be intelligible relatively to its
own presuppositions and true under its own conditions, so that
the ‘contradiction’ between them is generated merely because the
logical statement has abstracted from the special circumstances of
the case.</p>

<p>This situation is, of course, recognized very familiarly and
universally in the case of <i>value-judgements</i>. We are all willing to
admit that one man’s meat may be another man’s poison, that
it is vain to dispute about tastes, and that the same mode of living
does not suit all constitutions and all circumstances. We recognize,
too, that profound differences of opinion and attitude exist, and
always have existed, among men. The temperamental differences
which make e.g. one man indolent another enterprising, one man
daring another prudent, one a conservative another a radical, one
an optimist another a pessimist, are so deeply rooted in human
nature as to be, humanly speaking, ineradicable. And if so, must
it not be conceded that situations occur which will inevitably,
consistently, <i>and rightly</i>, be judged differently by these different
persons?</p>

<p>Again, it should be noted that these differences in valuation
are not merely subjective: they spring from objective differences
in human nature, and are as objective as any other facts about it.
For example, that certain persons dislike pork (because they
cannot digest it), and hate cats (because their presence makes
them feel ill), rests as much on a physiological fact of their constitution
as that others suffer from ‘hay fever’. Similarly, it
is quite plausible to contend that ‘every little boy and girl that
is born alive, is born a little liberal or a conservative’, and certainly
the normal growth of conservatism as the individual mind<span class="pagenum" title="277"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a></span>
ages is proof enough that changes of belief depend on psychological
law, and are correlated with the hardening of tissue which
is a general symptom of senescence. Again, is it possible to
imagine a situation so bad or so good that it cannot be interpreted
either optimistically or pessimistically? In most cases
either interpretation is quite easy, and the choice between them
is effected by sheer temperamental bias. If, then, we succeed in
doing what the natural man will always find difficult, and regard
such differences of opinion in a scientific and non-​partisan way,
must we not admit that <i>both</i> the conflicting standpoints are inevitable
and justifiable? Neither can be pronounced wrong in
general and <i>per se</i>, though in regard to a particular problem or
occasion either may be. Let us conclude, then, that it may really
be a ‘fact’ that the ‘facts’ justify one interpretation and attitude
to one mind and another to another.</p>

<p>This argument is reinforced by the further consideration that
even the most objective statements of fact involve <i>value-judgements</i>
in their ultimate analysis. For they express, often explicitly
and always implicitly, the choices and valuations by which a
variety of pretenders to reality have been examined and sifted,
and the most valuable have been declared ‘truly real’. We have
seen that in a scientific inquiry the ‘facts’ must always be taken
as <i>alleged</i> facts, discovered up to date; hence a science must
always be ready to defend the ‘facts’ it recognizes, when they
are challenged, and to show wherein they excel conflicting allegations.
The accepted ‘facts’ of a science, therefore, are always
allegations which are thought to possess greater <i>value</i> than any
known alternative; hence no sharp or absolute distinction between
judgements of fact and judgements of value can be maintained.
It becomes, moreover, quite possible that incompatible
allegations of fact may in the actual state of a science be so nearly
balanced that there is no convincing reason to prefer one to
another, or at any rate none that could prevail against any ordinary
temperamental bias. Consequently, in such cases the bias will
condition the visibility of the ‘fact’; it will be bathed in a
‘subjective’ atmosphere, and the ‘eye of faith’ will be necessary
to perceive it. No doubt such situations are inconvenient, and
repellent to the scientific spirit; but they do not occur only in
the misty regions of religion and philosophy, and scientific alternatives
like ‘chance’ or ‘design’, ‘miracle’ or ‘law’, ‘mechanism’
<span class="pagenum" title="278"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></span>or ‘vitalism’, determinism or indeterminism are essentially of this
order. There is no reason, therefore, why logic should not recognize
them and acknowledge that the scientific ‘facts’ may be
ambiguous, in the sense that further experience and experiments
are needed to determine their character. As a rule, to judge by
the past, further inquiry will resolve the ambiguity; but it may
well be an illusion to assume that it must do so, and in some of
the most important cases the decision will certainly be long in
coming.</p>

<p>Thus the student of animal behaviour will probably long be
left with a choice between minimizing the displays of animal
intelligence and assimilating them to the human, while it will
probably always be possible to put a pessimistic or an optimistic
interpretation upon the facts of life as a whole.</p>

<p>A scientific logic therefore should radically disabuse the mind
of any excessive trust in ‘facts’. It is a superstition that ‘facts’
are plain, straightforward, and easy to discover; they are often
subtle and recondite and relative to circumstances, changing their
aspect to suit their scientific environment like any chameleon.</p>

<p>§ 32. (<i>c</i>) In considering the use of words in research, one cannot
of course overlook the obvious fact that the employment of words
is primarily determined by their established meanings, and that
these greatly limit our freedom to use them as we please. Words
naturally and inevitably suggest their established uses by their
mere sounds, and should always be used with a proper respect for
their past history and present meaning. To be sensitive to this
appeal is the mark of the educated scholar; but it does not require
the investigator to exhaust his energies in vain attempts to stereotype
absolutely the current meanings, and so to deprive words
of their essential function. For their essential function is after
all to be instruments for the conveying of actual meaning, and
actual meanings are always more or less new (cf. <a href="#z12">§ 12</a>). It occurs
to a particular person in a particular situation to express and
convey a meaning which has never in its full concreteness occurred
before. If the novelty about this situation is appreciable and
important, it may well be that the old words will not fully succeed
in conveying the new meaning; and yet we shall always endeavour
to use them, and select from the accumulated wealth of
language the words which will suffice for our purpose. For the
alternative is worse; we cannot always be coining new words<span class="pagenum" title="279"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></span>
for every new meaning we may desire to convey; they would not
be understood or remembered, and even if they were, a science
that employed nothing but technical terms, and was moreover
compelled continually to change them, because it would not use
them to convey new meanings, would speedily degenerate into an
abstruse game, and could make no progress. How impracticable
such a policy would be may be gauged by the grave inconvenience
which even now systematists cause by so frequently changing the
scientific names of plants and animals. It is indispensable, therefore,
that words should retain a certain measure of plasticity, in
virtue of which they can be transferred from old situations to new
and be used to convey new meanings. Nor is there usually any
difficulty about thus imposing new duties on the old terms;
under the particular circumstances of the situation even wide
departures from the established meanings may remain intelligible,
and so the progress of science is not impeded.</p>

<p>The traditional logic, however, cannot treat the matter so
lightly. For the plasticity of words may always engender a
conflict between the old meaning and the new, between the
scientific use of terms and the traditional conventions about their
use. And this can always be represented as a defiance of the
‘laws of thought’. For if the meaning of ‘<i>A</i>’ may be altered
by the growth of knowledge, it will no longer be true that everything
once called ‘<i>A</i>’ is truly <i>A</i>, nor that what was once incompatible
with <i>A</i> will continue to be so for all time. Hence it is
no longer necessarily true that ‘<i>A</i> is <i>A</i>’, and that <i>A</i> cannot both
be and not be <i>B</i>. It may be both in different senses, and in what
sense ‘<i>A</i>’ and ‘<span class="pagenum" title="280"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a></span><i>B</i>’ should be taken may be precisely the point
at issue. Thus verbal contradiction ceases to be a clear proof of
error; it may be only a much-​needed warning that our terms
have been developing new meanings. Hence, the ‘laws’ of
Identity and Contradiction lose their last claims to be regarded
as statements of fact, and have to be conceived as ideal postulates
of just so much stability of meaning as is requisite for effective
<span class="nowrap">understanding.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></span> They can be applied to reality only hypothetically,
i.e. experimentally, to discover whether in a given situation
the natural growth in the meaning of the terms may <i>rightly</i>
be treated as irrelevant, and does not vitiate the conclusion
which the reasoning forecasts. Now this problem can never be
settled <i>a priori</i> by reasoning, but only by subsequent experience.
Reasoning may forecast a result which experience fails to confirm;
when we discover that comets’ tails are not attracted by the sun
but repelled, we do not declare the facts ‘contradictory’, but
modify our notion of ‘gravitation’, and conceive it as inferior
to ‘light pressure’ in its effects upon particles of a certain minuteness.</p>

<p>It follows that no merely logical scrutiny of the terms of an
argument can ever settle a scientific question. If a ‘contradiction’
is real, it means either a difference of opinion between those who
make the incompatible assertions, or, in the case of a real ‘self-​contradiction’,
the uttering of ‘nonsense’ and a failure to propound
a meaning at all. But even the most glaring ‘contradictions’
may only be apparent, i.e. verbal: when we inquire into their
actual meaning we may find that they refer to a context in which
its terms are perfectly compatible. Thus the existence of a ‘round
square’ may be predicated of London, and a ‘triangle’s’ angles
may equal or may exceed two right angles, according as it belongs
to Euclid’s geometry or to Riemann’s.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z33"></a>33. The problem of discovery, therefore, is never one of which
the solution can be guaranteed in advance. The resources of
a science are never sufficient to assure us of a prosperous issue of
the research, though, rightly understood, they yield important
safeguards. A recognition of the instrumental value of words as
ancillary to meaning, and of the limitations under which they
labour, will guard the inquirer against the terrible verbalism to
which logic has been enslaved. A critical attitude towards allegations
about ‘facts’ will enable him to minimize the dangers of
error, deception, and bigotry. A conception of ‘principles’ as
working hypotheses will discourage a servile and superstitious
reverence for them, and justify the fullest freedom to experiment
with whatever ideas hold out hopes of verification and of scientific
progress. Together these three considerations will pretty thoroughly
emancipate inquiry from the shackles of any mechanical
scheme of ‘proof’. Indeed, proof in the old formal sense will
have become a chimera. It will no longer be possible to cherish
the belief in a self-​sufficing, self-​satisfied form of absolute proof, of
which the pure logician imagined himself the possessor and retailer.</p>

<p>Scientific proof, on the other hand, will be neither absolute nor
formal. It will not be absolute, because it will always be relative<span class="pagenum" title="281"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></span>
to the actual condition of a science; it will not be formal, because
it will never be absolute. It will only be the best known interpretation,
and will always imply alternatives, to some of which
it may wrongly have been preferred, while to others it may be
destined to succumb (<a href="#z26">§§ 26</a>, <a href="#z27">27</a>). It will be ‘valid’ so long as
it is the strongest; but to it, as to the priest of Diana Nemorensis,
as to Uranus and Cronus, will come the day when it is invalidated
and superseded by a stronger and better, descended, it may well
be, from itself. Scientific proof then will always be an <i>evaluation</i>
of evidence, a making the most of the available resources of a
science, a question of the <i>comparative values</i> of rival interpretations.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that such an evaluation cannot operate
merely with the criteria of formal logic. Indeed, of the processes
known to the traditional logic, only those which <i>cannot</i> be represented
as ‘formally valid’ will be exemplified in scientific knowing.
It will not be possible to find any genuine cases of absolute certainty
or unconditional proof; but analogies, probabilities,
hypotheses, alternatives, even fallacies and fictions, will abound,
and will somehow have to be discounted. Clearly the evaluation
of such things will be a delicate affair; it cannot be accomplished
by reciting <i>Barbara Celarent</i> and crudely applying a few simple
mechanical formulas. It will demand the energetic co-operation
of the whole intelligence, and indeed of the whole personality,
and cannot scorn the aid of psychological factors. For it is plain
that the evaluation of a complicated scientific situation will
require both expert knowledge of scientific detail and philosophic
grasp of general principles and connexions; it will need also
‘tact’, ‘judgement’, an ‘eye from experience’, and a host of
similar qualities that elude precise verbal formulation. It will
no longer be practicable to flatter mediocrity and dullness, and
to impede discovery, by proclaiming methods that dispense with
imagination, ingenuity, originality, boldness, enterprise, and vainly
endeavour to put genius for discovery on a par with mindless
pedantry in applying stereotyped and sterile rules.</p>

<p>§ 34. But just because a logic that recognizes the actual
process of discovery does not presume to dictate formal methods
to the discoverer, and leaves him a very free hand, it does not
relieve him of any of the responsibility for conducting his researches
to a prosperous issue. As there is no longer any pretence
that any logical machinery can be devised to guarantee success,<span class="pagenum" title="282"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a></span>
success and failure become his personal achievements. If he fails,
he can no longer plead that it is not his fault, seeing that he has
kept every letter of the law and broken no logical rule. This may
be precisely <i>why</i> he failed. Perhaps he should have taken risks.
He may have gathered such enormous masses of fact that he could
no longer see through them, nor select the few that were relevant
to his problem. He may have been so sensible of the need for
caution that he dared not speculate or move. He may have devoted
himself to unimportant problems or missed the important
sides of important problems, or have wandered away into barren
wastes of dialectics, or have got bogged in a mire of verbalism, or
have pursued elusive phantoms of unverifiable speculations. For
there are clearly many ways of failing. Only in whatever way he
fails, his personal failure is <i>pro tanto</i> a failure of science to progress.
Every science has somehow to get hold of a clue to guide it through
the labyrinth of fact, and this clue has to lead it right, though it
need not ‘follow necessarily’ from previous knowledge.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if, and in so far as, a researcher succeeds in
making a discovery, some of his personal credit is reflected upon his
methods <i>ex-post facto</i>. Their success does not, of course, establish
their formal ‘validity’; but it stops the mouth of those who argued
that what is ‘invalid’ must be worthless. Methods that succeed
must have <i>value</i>, a greater thing than ‘validity’, however far and
however boldly they departed from the canons of formal proof.
The success has shown that <i>in this case</i> the inquirer was right to
select the facts he fixed upon as significant, and to neglect the rest
as irrelevant, to connect them as he did by the ‘laws’ he applied to
them, to theorize about them as he did, to perceive the analogies,
to weigh the chances, as he did, to speculate and to run the risks
he did. But only in this case. In the very next case, which he
takes to be ‘essentially the same’ as the last, and as nearly
analogous as is humanly possible, he may find that the differences
(which always exist between cases) are relevant, and that his
methods and assumptions have to be modified to cope with it
successfully. But he should not be discouraged. For the ultimate
ground of the whole cognitive procedure by which we analyse the
flow of events is empirical. It is only an empirical fact that knowledge
is possible, i.e. that the course of events is such that human
minds can analyse it at all, that is, can pick out and construct
cases of ‘the same’, of which the course can be predicted by means<span class="pagenum" title="283"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a></span>
of the (verbally) stable formulas we call ‘the laws of nature’.
For logic at any rate these laws are neither supernatural behests
nor metaphysical entities: they are forms for classifying happenings,
in which the blanks have to be filled in with the variable values
of the particular happenings. What the <i>right</i> values are, and even
what is the <i>right</i> formula to apply, will always depend on the
particular case which forms the actual problem. It is only the
empirical fact that the differences between problems may so often
be treated as irrelevant which generates the illusion that problems
may be solved in advance by general formulas: in reality every
problem in its full concreteness is unique, and we are never absolutely
sure that it will submit to the rule we apply to it. Hence
it is solved only when we come to it and find it amenable to our
methods; in principle it eludes logical prediction, because it can
be known as a ‘case’ of the successful ‘law’ only <i>after</i> the experiment
has confirmed the forecast. To the inquirer, therefore,
no result can seem certain until it has occurred; it is only <i>ex
post facto</i> that the logician can describe it as an indubitable case
of some law from which it follows of necessity. But in so doing
he has changed it, and repudiated the duty of describing actual
knowing. All he is doing is to rearrange a piece of knowledge,
acquired without his aid by means he condemns as illicit, in the
order he is pleased to call ‘logical’. This order has a certain
aesthetic value, but it is emphatically <i>not</i> the order of discovery,
and throws no light on the process of acquiring knowledge.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z35"></a>35. What function then can be assigned to the logician’s
reflection on the workings of science? In view of his failure to
substantiate his claim to have provided a model for inquiry in his
scheme of ‘proof’, it might seem that he was either useless or
pernicious. Useless, if he merely devotes himself to constructing
‘ideals of proof’ which he admits to have no relation to the
actual problems of science; pernicious, if he is prompted by these
ideals to make demands with which no science can comply, and
to deliver judgements which would paralyse the science that
attempted to carry them into execution. Fortunately, he cannot
enforce them, and the sciences actually go on their way, ignoring
such ‘logic’. The proper inference from his impotence is that he
would do well to take up a position which is more useful and more
influential, if less pretentious.</p>

<p>Let the logician then give up the pretence of dictating to the<span class="pagenum" title="284"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a></span>
sciences and of judging the worth of scientific truth by rigid forms
of absolute proof; let him abandon the vain pursuit of ‘validity’.
Nay, more, let him renounce the claim to determine the scientific
value of an argument by a mere inspection of its logical character.
Let him confess that what alone he can criticize is the incongruities
in its verbal expression, and that its real value lies beyond
his ken. If he will concede all this, his reward will be that he has
vindicated for logic an important right of more real value than
the claims he has abandoned. For he will have obtained the right
of summoning the sciences to state their results in intelligible and
consistent terms, and to confront them with a problem when they
do not. Just because he does not presume to condemn them,
and no longer ventures to declare that incompatible and verbally
‘contradictory’ results are necessarily wrong and worthless, but
only urges that they are not intelligible as they stand, and need to
be reworded or inquired into farther, he gains the right of <i>raising
problems</i>, and stimulates the sciences to proceed to solve them.</p>

<p>It should be noted, moreover, that the problems thus raised are
general, not special, i.e. are properly logical. The problem about
‘contradictory’ results is one about meaning, for contradictory
assertions cancel each other’s (apparent) meaning. This enables
the logician to keep the sciences engaged upon the logical problem
of solving the discrepancies between their results, so long as the
sciences do not form one complete and congruous system, i.e.
indefinitely.</p>

<p>Similarly the denial that truth is absolute is a general truth
that affects all the sciences. It should stimulate them all, for
it means that no statement is so perfect that it cannot be bettered
and that no limits can be set to the progress of science.</p>

<p>Other topics which are ‘logical’, because they concern the
general significance of scientific procedure and not the solution of
particular problems, are the nature and importance of selecting
‘facts’ and the ‘laws’ they are taken to exemplify, the experimental
attitude and the framing of hypotheses, the evaluation of
probabilities and alternatives, the estimation of relevance and of
verifications and of the amounts of the latter which are requisite
and the sorts of it which are relevant. On all these points logic
has hitherto had little or nothing to say, mainly because they did
not lend themselves to formal treatment. Lastly, there are two
extremely important subjects, which are so vital to the logic of dis<span class="pagenum" title="285"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a></span>covery
that a brief discussion of them may fitly conclude this essay.
We may call them the problem of Novelty and the problem of Risk.</p>

<p>§ <a id="z36"></a>36. In Logic we are not concerned with the metaphysics of
Novelty, i.e. with the problem of whether there ever enter the
world things that are really and truly unforeseen and unpredictable,
that pop into it from nowhere, and if so, whether and how we can
understand such things. This problem is deep and difficult, and
so, until recently, philosophers have fought shy of it, and used to
settle it off-hand by a flat denial that such things could be in
a ‘rational’ universe. But now that M. Bergson has given us a
radically new metaphysic, and that we are beginning to perceive
that the principles used to dispose of the matter, viz. causality
and the conservation of energy, are essentially methodological, the
question has become an open one.</p>

<p>Logic, however, has no need to probe it; it can treat it more
simply. For its purposes it can, and must, treat novelty as a real
logical fact. It is a psychological fact, and logic must note it,
that every moment of our life has for us a certain flavour of newness;
it is also a fact that every real judgement that is ever made
has a certain relation to <span class="nowrap">novelty.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></span> Its maker believes, either that
it embodies a new truth, or that though known to him it is new
to his hearers. If he did not believe this he would have no motive
to make it. It would be stale repetition, devoid of interest or value
alike to him and to others, whom he would merely bore by telling
them what they, too, knew already.</p>

<p>So far, then, the logical nature of novelty seems simple. It
gives rise to problems, however, when we consider the relation
of the new truth to the old. It is clear, in the first place, that the
new truth must affect the old. Even where we are willing to
minimize its novelty, and to call it merely an ‘extension’ of what
we already knew, it must modify it and change its value. For in
the light of the new developments the old truth <i>means more</i>: it
has relations in an enlarged field of knowledge. Moreover, the
new truth is often not merely an extension but also a <i>correction</i>,
and the effect of the correction may sometimes be revolutionary.
It may even seem to upset the old beliefs altogether, though<span class="pagenum" title="286"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a></span>
human ingenuity is far too fertile in building bridges (often only
verbal) from the old to the new to allow this impression to be
permanent. Still in all these cases there is more or less discrepancy
between the new and the old.</p>

<p>The logician, however, should insist that this fact should not
be blinked. He should recognize the discrepancy, and emphasize
its significance, just because for other purposes it is usually convenient
to ignore it. For it is not only the source of real ambiguity
in the facts of science, and of the important differences of opinion
among men and of their obstinate persistence, but the justification
of the policy of open-​mindedness and toleration which he regards
as necessary to scientific progress. Inasmuch as of every discrepancy
between the old truth and the new it will be possible to
take two views, and either to cling to the old or to put one’s trust
in the new, there will always be a party of conservation and a party
of innovation, or otherwise a conservative and a liberal bias, in
science as in politics. It is, moreover, futile to discuss, in the
abstract, which of them is right: for it would clearly be fatal to
go all lengths with either. Science could make no progress, either
if every novelty were at once condemned and suppressed because
of its failure to conform with the accepted doctrine, or if everything
new were hailed as true regardless of its concordance with
the old truth, so that the course of science became a series of
radical revolutions that had no consistent direction. In concrete
cases of course both sides are sometimes right, though historically
the stronger bias men have shown has been the conservative.
What usually happens is that the new truth is first denounced as
an immoral invention which is subversive of all intelligible order
and cosmic rationality; it is then quietly assimilated and not
infrequently converted in the end into the strongest support of the
beliefs it was alleged to subvert. But it would be a real gain if
logic, by viewing this natural feature of knowing in its generality,
could induce men of science to take it more calmly. If it were
generally recognized that every claim to new truth, however great
the advantages it promises, necessarily entails certain inconveniences,
because the old beliefs and notions have to be modified
and readjusted, and this may involve too great an effort to be
worth while, or an effort too great for certain minds, it would be
seen that there are two sides to every question, and that both
may be in a way legitimate. If, in addition, we recognize that<span class="pagenum" title="287"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a></span>
the parties concerned usually have a bias which may render them
dangerously blind to the case of the other side, and that both
should be admonished to discount their bias duly, we shall have
done not a little to secure <span class="nowrap">fair-​minded<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></span> consideration, reasonable
discussion, and intelligent choice between the alternatives. And
all this surely conduces to scientific progress.</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that the problem of relating the new to the
old always exists, and has a vital influence on the fortunes of every
science. But it is not capable of any formal or abstract solution
<i>a priori</i>. Which is to be preferred is a matter which must be left
to the expert who is cognizant of the circumstances of the case:
logic can help only by broadening his mind, and putting him on
his guard against his own personal bias, which might otherwise
unconsciously determine his decision.</p>

<p>§ 37. To admit that scientific inquiries concern problems, and
that to every problem (at least) two solutions may be propounded,
between which a choice has to be made, is to admit that knowledge
<i>must take risks</i> in order to progress. For there is always the risk
of choosing the wrong solution of a problem, i.e. the one which
works <i>less</i> well, just as there are always risks of choosing a bad
problem and of selecting the wrong facts and the wrong theories
to explain them withal. Nevertheless, we ought not to resent this
fact. For the taking of risks is inevitable: we cannot escape it
either by refusing to inquire or by refusing to decide. For in either
case we run the risk of missing a valuable truth.</p>

<p>It is better, therefore, to recognize that every act of knowing
must involve risks, just as every act of living does; and this for
the simple reason that knowing is an activity comprised in living,
and every judgement is an <i>act</i>, which might have been left undone,
or for which another might have been substituted. The readiness
of the new conception of logic to emphasize the existence of risks
in all reasoning, and to sanction the willingness to take them,<span class="pagenum" title="288"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a></span>
contrasts markedly with the vain efforts of the old logic to play for
safety, and to make no move that was not absolutely necessary
(cf. <a href="#z10">§ 10</a>). This was why it postulated absolutely certain premisses,
and would contemplate nothing but ‘valid’ forms of reasoning.
In its desire to elevate its proofs above the perplexities and vicissitudes
of mundane problems, the old logic was expressing and
comforting a deep-​seated human craving: for life is so replete
with the most hideous risks that it is a natural instinct to clutch
at any promise of security. Hence the passionate and almost
religious reverence with which formal logic has been regarded for
over 2,000 years. Many philosophers still worship the syllogism,
because it seems to them an incomparable exemplar of absolute
security firmly fixed in the sphere of immutable necessity far above
the flux of phenomena, which it illumines with its steady radiance.
But to exalt in this way its ideal of proof, the old logic had to
pay a heavy price. The price was cutting the ideal wholly adrift
from the actual, contemplating exclusively a situation which could
never occur in real life, and leaving all actual inquiry to its devices,
unstudied, uncriticized, and unaided. Thus, the splendid aloofness
of the logical ideal was purchased by a total repudiation of actual
science. To many philosophic minds this price does not seem
excessive. The more useless truth is made to appear, the purer
and more admirable it seems to them. An ideal, they think,
should be like Aristotle’s ‘god’; it should attract, without uplifting,
and without running the risk of contamination by the dirty
work of life.</p>

<p>These philosophers have always claimed for their attitude that
it is philosophic <i>par excellence</i>. But their claim, besides being based
on a somewhat rare personal idiosyncrasy, is not really sound.
It is neither self-​consistent nor a sound policy for life. An ideal
which repudiates the actual, and yet professes somehow to be its
exemplar, is left in the impossible condition of the Platonic ‘Idea’.
If it were as superhuman as it claims to be, no human mind could
even speculate about it. And we have seen (<a href="#z13">§ 13</a>) that it is not
in the end possible to devise a form of proof which is bomb-proof
against the attacks of experience and superior to verification.</p>

<p>Is it not wiser, then, to admit that life has its claims upon
science, and science upon logic? We simply <i>must</i> have a science
that can handle human life and meet human needs, and does not
degenerate into a game with arbitrary and fantastic rules which<span class="pagenum" title="289"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></span>
depart from the actual conditions of life in any direction and
to any distance unrestrained imagination carries them; and our
logic must deign to study such a science. If to do so it has to
‘scrap’ its antique ‘ideals’, to abandon its pose of an inhuman,
impassible, infallible aloofness, and to interest itself in the doubting,
questioning, guessing, trying, risking, blundering, correcting,
achieving that make up the sum of human knowledge, it will
receive an ample reward in the gratitude of man for a logic that
has entered his service, and in the salutary influence which it will
exercise upon his actions.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Conclusions</i></p>

<p>(1) We have shown, negatively, that the notion of a form of
proof, by which conclusions can be absolutely demonstrated by
dint of pure logic alone, is a delusion. No such form can be constructed
(<a href="#z13">§§ 13</a>, <a href="#z15">15</a>), and if it could, it could neither find scientific
material worthy of it (<a href="#z28">§ 28</a>), nor contain the material which is
fabricated by the sciences.</p>

<p>(2) We have thereby shown that formal logic cannot represent
the logical nature of discovery or of any of the processes of actual
knowing, and must condemn them all as ‘invalid’ (<a href="#z18">§§ 18</a>, <a href="#z20">20</a>, <a href="#z26">26</a>, <a href="#z28">28</a>).</p>

<p>(3) We have seen that a logic which attempts to understand
actual knowing cannot prescribe to the sciences how they are to
solve their problems (<a href="#z33">§ 33</a>).</p>

<p>(4) But it <i>can</i> grasp the general character of scientific procedure,
appreciate its difficulties and dangers, understand the expedients
for meeting them, and trace it to its roots in the constitution of
the human mind and in the needs of life (<a href="#z35">§ 35</a>).</p>

<p>(5) In virtue of its general grasp of the aim and method of the
sciences a logic of science can at times offer advice to scientists:
it may draw their attention to the general problems which their
work involves, but which are apt to be overlooked by specialists,
such as the claims of consistency and novelty and the regulation
of risks (<a href="#z36">§ 36</a>). Or, better still, if they will study it themselves,
it may broaden their minds and enable them to handle these
general problems for themselves far more effectively than a pure
logician could do it for them.</p>

<p>(6) By abandoning its pretensions to rigour and conclusiveness
logic does not really lose: it gains immensely by coming into
contact with science and life, and becoming of use in the world.</p>

not in fact anywhere speak of a <i>special work</i> with this title or of this character.
What he does write is as follows (<i>Vita</i>, lib. ii, cap. i, Migne, col. 101): ‘Igitur
beata virgo <span class="ell">..</span>. librum visionum <span class="ell">..</span>. consummavit et <i>quaedam</i> de natura hominis

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">32</span></a> It is not enough to suppose with some of her biographers that the visions
were dictated by Hildegard and were latinized by a secretary. The visions
imply a good deal of study and considerable book-learning. Among many reasons
for believing that she had a very serviceable knowledge of Latin are the following:
</p>
<p>
(<i>a</i>) She was well acquainted with the Biblical writings and quotes them aptly
and frequently.
</p>
<p>
(<i>b</i>) She was regarded by her contemporaries as an authority on scriptural
interpretation and on Church discipline, and was frequently consulted by them
on these subjects.
</p>
<p>
(<i>c</i>) She pleaded in person before clerical tribunals.
</p>
<p>
(<i>d</i>) One of the least remarkable and most credible of her ‘miracles’, the
expounding of certain letters found upon an altar-cloth (Migne, col. 121), depends
entirely on a knowledge of Latin.
</p>
<p>
(<i>e</i>) In the <i>Liber divinorum operum</i> (Migne, col. 922) she writes ‘firmamentum
<i>celum</i> nominavit quoniam omnia <i>excellit</i>’, a derivation taken from Isidore and
incomprehensible to one ignorant of Latin. There are many other passages in her
works in which the sense depends on the Latin usage of a word.
</p>
<p>
(<i>f</i>) No mention of this ignorance is made by Guibert in the short sketch of
her life that he wrote almost immediately after her death (1180; see Pitra,
p.&nbsp;407). On the contrary, he suggests that she had been an industrious student.
</p>
<p>
(<i>g</i>) The <i>Liber divinorum operum</i> may especially be pointed out among her
works as betraying a very considerable degree of learning. Notably her elaborate
doctrine of the macrocosm and microcosm must have involved extensive reading.
</p>
<p>
The general question of Hildegard’s knowledge of Latin has also been discussed

(Valentine Rose, ‘Die Lücke im Diogenes Laërtus und der alte Übersetzer’

which was completed about 1150. It is, of course, possible that the references to the

K. Sudhoff, <i>Arch. f. Gesch. d. Med.</i>, ii. 84, Leipzig, 1910. The relation of the central
figure to the signs of the zodiac in this plate bears a manifest resemblance
to the relation of the central figure to the beasts’ heads in Plate vii. The lines
which cross and recross the figure in Plate <span class="lowercase smcap">VII</span> are analogous also to the lines of
influence of Plate <span class="lowercase smcap">XVI</span>. The verse above the figure in Plate <span class="lowercase smcap">XVI</span> is taken from the

<p><a name="Footnote_125_125" id="Footnote_125_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125_125"><span class="label">125</span></a> How rarely dissections were conducted in some of the Universities may be
gathered from the first statutes of the medical faculty of Tübingen, dated 1497.
These ordain a dissection <i>every three or four years</i>. Not till 1601 was an anatomy
held at Tübingen even once a year (see Säxinger, loc. cit.). Even at Montpellier
in the sixteenth century the scarcity was so great that Rondelet (1507–66) was
on one occasion reduced to dissect the body of his son. For this terrible incident
see A. Portal, <i>Histoire de l’Anatomie et Chirurgie</i>, Paris, 1770, vol. i, p.&nbsp;522;
A. Haller, <i>Bibliotheca anatomica</i>, Lib. iv, § clxxxiv, Leyden, 1774, vol. i, p.&nbsp;205;
and A.&nbsp;O. Goelicke, <i>Introductio in historiam litterariam anatomes</i>, Frankfurt, 1738,
p.&nbsp;136. There was, however, a relatively plentiful supply of subjects in the
Italian Universities and especially at Bologna and Padua in the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries (cp. A. Haller, <i>Bibliotheca anatomica</i>, introduction
to Lib. v, p.&nbsp;218). This was perhaps due to the utterly depraved state of
public and private morals to which the peoples of the peninsula had been reduced
by the excesses of the tyrants and the condottieri.</p></div>

French MS. of the <i>Grande Chirurgie</i> of Guy de Chauliac, Bibliothèque de la Faculté
de Médecine de Montpellier, MS. 184 français, folio 14 recto. The scene is laid
in the bedroom of the deceased. In the left-hand top corner is the bed, by the
side of which a female figure, partly obliterated, is praying. Below and to the
left are two other female figures, and a man richly dressed in an ermine-trimmed
robe. These are presumably the relatives of the dead. The corpse, that of
a woman, has been placed on a bare table and is opened from the larynx to the
symphysis pubis. In front stands a lad holding a round wooden vessel for the
reception of the viscera, and farther to the right is a stool on which are placed
two or three instruments. The physician, in full canonicals, is at the extreme
right of the picture. The actual process of examination is being made by three
of his assistants. To the left the first of these deepens, with a knife, the incision
that has already been made over the sternum, the second is grasping with his
two hands and rolling up the great omentum so as to display the viscera beneath,
and the third holds a wand in his right hand, with which he points to the abdomen,
while in his left he carries a book. Five others throng into the room from a passage
which opens into it.</p></div>

Gradibus), who was professor of Medicine at Pavia 1432–72, made original
contributions to anatomy. He wrote no separate work on anatomy, but his
observations on the ovaries (which he was perhaps the first to call by that name)
appear in his <i>Practica</i>, Milan, 1471, and in his <i>Expositiones super vigesimam
secundam Fen tertii canonis Avicennae</i>, Milan, 1494. An interesting account of
Ferrari’s life and work is given by his descendant, H.&nbsp;M. Ferrari, in <i>Une Chaire
de Médecine au XV<sup>e</sup> siècle; Un professeur a l’université de Pavie de 1432 à 1472</i>,
Paris, 1899. In this work the claim that De Gradibus was an original and independent
observer is effectively disposed of.</p></div>

the <i>Tractatus de Causis et Indiciis Morborum</i>&mdash;the <i>Hauptwerk</i> of Maimonides, as it is
called by Haeser&mdash;rests upon an error. In his catalogue of Bodleian books (p.&nbsp;1926)
he puts the book down as a bookseller’s fraud after what is obviously only a cursory
glance. He says ‘fraude bibliopolae ex variis opp. imperfectis confictus est, in

fatal this difficulty is to the traditional notion of formal validity; nor has any
logician confuted his argument, or even shown that he apprehended its meaning
and scope. It would seem, therefore, that the condition of formal logic is so
precarious that its only chance of survival lies in hushing up all the vital objections
to its stereotyped doctrines. But is not the policy of ignoring unanswerable
objections the sure mark of a pseudo-science?</p></div>

when history is called a science, it is often forgotten that its data are essentially
such that they can only occur once, while the material of the other sciences is
such that cases of ‘the same’ may always be found in it. But neither need it
be denied on this account that history can, and should, be written in a scientific
spirit.</p></div>

wanted is, not that the inquiring mind should take no interest in the conclusions
it considers, but that, though it cares keenly and even passionately for one of
them, it should yet be capable of sufficient self-control to consider fairly the case
<i>against</i> the conclusion it favours. This mental attitude is probably best secured by
caring more for truth than for a party victory, and is denominated a ‘disinterested
love of truth for its own sake’. But even so we love what we deem the truth,
because it is the <i>best</i> thing to believe, and better (on the whole and in the end)
than anything else that is propounded.</p></div>
